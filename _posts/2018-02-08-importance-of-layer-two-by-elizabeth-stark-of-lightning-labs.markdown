[Elizabeth Stark](https://twitter.com/starkness?lang=en), CEO & Co-founder of [Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering/), shares the evolution of the internet all the way to the concept of a completely decentralized virtual world, focusing on a particular technology – blockchain. Addressing the inherent scalability issues of blockchains, Stark offers a way to solve the problem with creating a “Layer Two” – a peripheral network that settles transactions on its own blockchain rather than having all transactions settled on a premium global blockchain.

[Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering/) is a company that is developing Lightning, an overlay network built on top of an existing blockchain protocol. Similar to how the Internet is built in layers, Lightning creates an entirely new layer, offering instant, high-volume payments that are denominated in the blockchain’s native currency.
