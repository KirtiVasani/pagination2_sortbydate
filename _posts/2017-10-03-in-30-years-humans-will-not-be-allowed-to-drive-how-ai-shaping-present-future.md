<p>It’s almost unbelievable how we are no longer speaking of how artificial intelligence (AI) WILL shape our FUTURE. We are at a point in history when AI IS shaping our PRESENT. Most interestingly, it is happening in a large array of the areas of our lives, often without our explicit understanding where does it start and end. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steinbuch/">Maarten Steinbuch</a>, a Distinguished University Professor at <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>, on the <a href="http://www.singularityugermanysummit.org/">SingularityU Germany Summit 2017</a>, shares his futuristic views closely tied to current technological capabilities and increasing computational power of computers. Steinbuch streams a fascinating real-life experiment displaying how autonomous vehicles (robots, essentially) are negotiating with each other on the road (on the fly, virtually!) to avoid an inevitable collision. <i>“Every year, there are 1.4 million deaths in traffic worldwide,”</i> says Steinbuch following a mind-blowing display. <i>“I predict that in 30 years from now, humans will not be allowed to drive on the road anymore</i>,<i>” </i>he continues.</p>
<p>I strongly encourage you to watch this presentation that goes beyond objects, where Steinbuch offers a data and example-driven support for what the human life would look with AI, where:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Love is not exclusive to live creatures</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Ageing becomes a sickness that AI can cure</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Human body capabilities are extended and expanded by AI</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Knowledge is free, and the future of education is about experience</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">AI can be better doctors (microsurgery – the most advanced robotic surgeons are 3X better in performing operations than the best human surgeon), judge, and perform high-skilled works better than a human </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">AI changes industrial robotics and the industry 4.0 (there is a first employment agency for robots!)</li>
</ul>
