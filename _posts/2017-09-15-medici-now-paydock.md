<p><b>Company Name: </b><a href="https://paydock.com/">PayDock</a></p>
<p><b>Name/Title:</b> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roblincolne/">Robert Lincolne</a>, CEO </p>
<p><b>Industry Segment: </b>Payments</p>
<p><b>Target Markets: </b>Asia-Pacific, UK, USA</p>
<p><b>LTP: Tell us a little bit about yourself. </b></p>
<p><b>Robert Lincolne: </b>When I’m not being referred to as a left-handed Tasmanian, I’m a passionate entrepreneur with over 14 years of experience in digital strategy, analytics and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/overview-of-the-payments-industry/">payments</a>. I worked early-on in the not-for-profit sector, solving complex payment needs which ultimately drove me to create PayDock as a broader market offering. </p>
<p><b>LTP: Give us a paragraph pitch of your company.</b></p>
<p><b>RL: </b>PayDock is a unique payments platform that removes feature-set, data and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/how-can-regtechs-help-financial-services-industry-overcome-the-burden-of-compliance/">compliance barriers</a> for online merchants who need access to <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/overview-of-the-payments-industry/">multiple payment types</a> worldwide. We provide developer tooling, SDKs, and a single API to access all payments services while also taking care of compliance needs. In a nutshell, we improve customer experiences and reduce cost in the payments stack without the typical fragmentation of personal and payment data.</p>
<p><b>LTP: In a sentence or two, what problem are you solving today? </b></p>
<p><b>RL: </b>Online merchants and resellers cannot efficiently connect and deliver payment services to their customers and their businesses are limited as a result. Integration costs, compliance gaps and data fragmentation also combine to limit growth and reduce <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/payments-a-fading-experience/">market access for new payment methods and services</a>. PayDock solves these issues for both parties in a single service.</p>
<p><b>LTP: Who are you selling to?</b></p>
<p><b>RL: </b>Online marketplaces and resellers as well as larger online merchants who value the freedom to easily build and evolve payment ecosystems without becoming trapped.</p>
<p><b>LTP: Why did you start the company? </b></p>
<p><b>RL: </b>PayDock was created as a response to significant profit erosion experienced by online sellers. Navigating the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-digital-payments-industry-in-north-america-will-bring-half-a-trillion-in-e-commerce-retail-sales-by-2018/">complex world of online payments</a> is tough and we saw an opportunity to re-empower merchants and reduce payment system costs by as much as 80% in a typical platform.</p>
<p><b>LTP: What's the most important change coming to your segment in the next 3-5 years?</b></p>
<p><b>RL:</b> Banking-as-a-service platforms mixed with a rise in <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/mobile-wallets-when-too-many-pays-wont-let-anyone-win/">alternative payment methods</a> will <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/customer-experience-as-a-competitive-advantage-in-banking/">change the face of consumer experiences</a> with increased options and a consolidation of identity whether online or offline.</p>
<p><b>LTP: What’s your next milestone?</b></p>
<p><b>RL: </b>Our next milestone is to penetrate the UK and Asia market.</p>
<p><b>LTP: Anything else you want to say to our audience?</b></p>
<p><b>RL:</b> Great to have such an enthusiastic community out there – please connect with me anytime on Twitter via <a href="https://twitter.com/roblincolne">@roblincolne</a>. </p>
<h4><strong>Bonus – User’s Choice Question!</strong></h4>
<p><b>LTP: What's one thing you wish customers knew before a sales meeting? </b></p>
<p><b>RL: </b>How much money they were actually losing in their payments configuration.</p>
<p><b>LTP: If you could change one thing that financial services people do incorrectly, what would that be?</b></p>
<p><b>RL: </b>Not getting in their customers’ shoes enough.</p>
<p><b>LTP: What keeps you awake at night?</b></p>
<p><b>RL: </b>I think we have an enormous opportunity to make a difference in a very challenging area. Our KPIs are really around the benefit we give our clients, and we want to see our customers grow 100x and to know that we helped. I think this vision gives me the motivation to keep pushing, so I’m often there in bed thinking about how to help the company move further and faster in that goal. </p>
<p><b>LTP: Thank you, Robert!</b></p>
