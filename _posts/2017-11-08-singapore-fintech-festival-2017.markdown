<h2>Singapore's FinTech is on the way to global leadership</h2>
<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/singapores-fintech-industry-global-leadership/">Singapore</a> is one of the gems of the global financial services industry ecosystem with ~200 banks with total assets of $2 trillion having operational headquarters in the city. Global financial institutions like <a href="http://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/mastercard-to-launch-singapore-innovation-rd-center/">Mastercard</a>, <a href="https://www.ubs.com/magazines/innovation/en/about-us.html">UBS</a>, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/dbs-invests-7-1-million-to-build-a-silicon-valley-in-singapore/">DBS Bank</a>, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/ocbc-bank-launches-fintech-innovation-lab-in-singapore/">OCBC</a>, <a href="http://thefinlab.com/">UOB,</a> and <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/citiforcities/home_articles/n_singapore.htm">Citigroup</a> have already launched their <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/88-international-startup-accelerators-incubators-innovation-labs-nurturing-innovators-in-financial-services/">innovation labs and accelerators</a> in Singapore along with significant investments in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Singapore has one of the most forward-thinking governing authorities in the financial services industry internationally. To support the development of a vibrant FinTech ecosystem (there are <a href="http://directory.singaporefintech.org/">400+ FinTech Startups </a>incorporated in Singapore), MAS has taken steps to ensure Singapore’s leading position as a leading global FinTech hub: those include <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/singapore-fintech-festival-fintech-hubs-flight-to-the-top/">committing S$225 million under the Financial Sector Technology &amp; Innovation (FSTI) scheme;</a> the launch of the FinTech and Innovation Group (FTIG) and the FinTech Office; creation of a <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/international-fintech-regulatory-sandboxes-launched-by-forward-thinking-financial-authorities/">FinTech regulatory sandbox;</a> a move towards an open-API architecture; the “Singapore Payment Roadmap,” and the opening of the MAS’ FinTech innovation lab – the “Looking Glass @ MAS,” amongst other first-of-their-kind initiatives.</p>
<p>Not only does Singapore offer the most fertile ground for innovators to launch and test their solutions, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/singapore-is-shaping-up-to-become-the-blockchain-center-of-the-world/">the country is also paving its way into becoming the blockchain center of the world</a>. At the end of October, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sopnendu">Sopnendu Mohanty</a>, Chief FinTech Officer of MAS, announced that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/26/singapore-cryptocurrency-blockchain-trial.html">Singapore will conclude its experiment with blockchain technology and its own digital currency in 2018</a> before deciding whether to commercialize the trial. In 2016, MAS announced <a href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/Singapore-Financial-Centre/Smart-Financial-Centre/Project-Ubin.aspx">"Project Ubin,"</a> an exploration of DLT. Now, the MAS trial is looking at delivering securities, cross-border payments and, finally, using a digital version of the Singapore dollar to carry out real transactions and buy assets. Several major banks – including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Credit Suisse – are involved in the project.</p>
<p>The concept of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-magic-of-open-apis/">open APIs</a> is not just a concept for financial institutions in Singapore. A number of banks have embraced this wonderful opportunity, and OCBC Bank is one of the leaders in this field via its <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/leading-api-bandwagon-apac-connect2ocbc-story/">Connect2OCBC platform</a> – an open API platform – and the vast set of transactional APIs that was released for the external developer community. Connect2OCBC was launched in May 2016, an initiative that made OCBC Bank become the first bank in Southeast Asia to launch an open API platform. This platform enables external developers and FinTech players to collaborate with OCBC Bank as an innovation partner. It also helps them to develop unique applications that will add value to OCBC’s customers. This essentially is a clarion call to the creative technological talent available in the market to join forces with OCBC Bank and take a step towards digital, open banking. The efforts made by the Singapore government to cultivate a “Smart Nation,” along with a regulatory environment that encourages innovation, have helped OCBC Bank plug into the “open data economy.”</p>
<p>Since the launch, OCBC has received more than <a href="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/dbs-launches-worlds-largest-banking-api-developer-platform">150,000 APIs</a> calls or requests across all its APIs. The bank was also the first in Singapore to launch a transactional API for GIRO, setup in September 2017.</p>
<p>Another major institution – <a href="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/dbs-launches-worlds-largest-banking-api-developer-platform">DBS – launched the world's largest banking API developer platform</a> at the beginning of November, boasting of 50+ successful collaborations. All in all, DBS has launched 155 APIs for Singapore across more than 20 categories; more categories will be added in response to demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-gledhill-52142036/">David Gledhill</a>, DBS Group CIO, <a href="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/dbs-launches-worlds-largest-banking-api-developer-platform">said,</a> "DBS embarked on a journey to transform our tech infrastructure nine years ago. With that early start, we are now ahead of many others in being digital to the core. This has given us an edge – enabling us to operate with FinTech-like ability and nimbleness, and also platform-like inclusiveness."</p>
<h2>Singapore FinTech Festival 2017 – FinTech Hub's Flight to the Top </h2>
