<p><b>MIAMI – October 10, 2017 – </b><a href="http://www.novopayment.com">NovoPayment</a>, a leading enabler of digital financial and transactional services throughout the Americas, today announced the launch of its <a href="http://developer.novopayment.com">Developer Hub</a>, the first bank-agnostic application protocol interface (API) portal of its kind offering resources to software developers seeking payment and financial service related APIs to build new solutions, enhance existing products and accelerate their initiatives. The portal’s current 37 APIs address a diverse range of Latin American geographies and verticals including banking, service organizations, insurance, urban delivery and transportation, and travel.</p>
<p>With the launch of its Developer Hub, NovoPayment is releasing a number of powerful APIs including those aimed at Account Creation (individuals, enterprise, merchants, banking agents); Cash Transfers (cash-in and cash-out, P2P [peer-to-peer], cash disbursements and collections); Account Inquiries (account balance, recent transactions, transaction history, transactions by category, agent commission history); Compliance and Customer Support Tools (account/card verification, blocking and replacement, report lost or stolen card, automated support). </p>
<p>“We’re proud to be joining the open API movement and to do our part in enabling banks, financial institutions, FinTechs and their customers, and others in the developer community to transform their businesses and products, and deliver enhanced customer experiences (CX),” said NovoPayment CEO, Anabel Perez. “These tools and others to come will help enable and accelerate the digital transformation of financial services in the Americas, providing a new means for organizations to extend their digital ecosystems, positively impact their customer’s value chains and overcome many common transactional bottlenecks,” she added.</p>
