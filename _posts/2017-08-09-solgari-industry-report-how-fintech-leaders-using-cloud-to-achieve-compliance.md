<p>In the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis, financial services regulators introduced a number of new measures to safeguard both the integrity and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/cybersecurity-advantages-for-banks-2017/">security of the financial system</a>. A key component was much stricter communications <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/regtech-companies-europe/">compliance</a> regulations, including several directives to improve communications and increase transparency in order to mitigate future risk.</p>
<h4><strong>Confidence in the Cloud</strong></h4>
<p>The financial services sector has previously been hesitant to engage with cloud communications platforms due to misconceptions about <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-benefits-of-cloud-based-banking-infrastructure/">cloud security</a> and loss of control of highly sensitive data. However, recognition from regulatory agencies and standards bodies regarding the value of cloud services in meeting compliance has facilitated the large-scale adoption of cloud telephony by financial services companies. <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/international-fintech-regulatory-sandboxes-launched-by-forward-thinking-financial-authorities/">Support from such governing bodies</a> has given <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">private and public FinTech companies</a> the confidence to embrace cloud communications.</p>
<p>The companies that operate in different offices or in different countries need to meet a number of communication requirements, including being able to archive all calls to meet FCA compliance. They require a communication solution that can allow them to address compliance requirements. A cloud telephony solution provides a number of revolutionary features that securely and efficiently meet today’s FCA, Central Bank, SEC, MiFID, and PCI DSS compliance requirements.</p>
<p>Where previously firms have met communications compliance through heavy investment in disjointed, outdated, on-premise technologies that consume significant capital on a continuing basis, cloud-based telephony now offers a more secure, seamless and cost-effective way to address compliance issues. The other main advantage of using a cloud-based service is that it allows companies to satisfy the current compliance requirements while making sure that the company will be able to meet future requirements as well – the cloud remains updated on communications regulations.</p>
