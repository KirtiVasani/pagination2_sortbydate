<p>In October, in addition to its resident startups, the <a href="https://www.campus.co/sao-paulo/en/">Google Space Campus São Paulo</a> will house a group of FinTech startups selected for the first edition of Campus Latam Exchange FinTech. <a href="https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/">Campus Exchange</a> brings best-in-class startups from around the world to Campus for a week-long program to grow their businesses. Startups will spend an intense week of immersion with access to customized content, mentoring sessions with Google experts and will connect with the main players that are transforming the industry in <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/brazil-will-become-the-leading-fintech-market-in-latin-america-qa-with-the-head-of-google-campus-in-san-paolo/">Brazil – the leading FinTech market in Latin America</a>. </p>
<p><i>"Even with different legislations, it is possible to identify users with similar characteristics in emerging countries, so Latin American FinTech startups can become companies that solve not only local problems but the entire region,"</i> said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrebarrence/">André Barrence</a>, Head of Campus São Paulo at Google.</p>
<p>Among the <a href="https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/campuses/">Campuses</a> around the world, São Paulo was the first Google Space Campus to launch a residency program. The <a href="https://brasil.googleblog.com/2016/08/campus-sao-paulo-conheca-primeira-turma.html">first group started in August 2016</a>, achieved great results – 15 startups of that group received more than R$ 4.6 million in investments, and 11 of them grew their teams, creating a total of 31 jobs during the 6 months of the program.</p>
