Five years ago, hosting the first ever Money20/20 event, we could see something coming… a confluence of industries, the adoption of mobile and open platforms, a focus on new business models empowered by technology… today we call it FinTech!

In the years since, we continued the journey with Let's Talk Payments (LTP), a curated insights platform that today has more than 100,000 subscribers and millions of annual views globally. LTP quickly became the world’s #1 digital destination for FinTech trends and analysis. We thank each of you for your support along the way.

The MEDICI knowledge portal was a natural extension of LTP, together offering proprietary research and data, and expertly organized so that the complex maze of FinTech could be navigated with ease. This shared resource has become FinTech’s digital watering hole, a place where financial institutions and startups identify and accelerate game-changing collaborations, facilitated by investors, accelerators and hundreds of innovation programs.

As the FinTech space has grown and undergone rapid change, so have we. And as we reflect on these changes, we want to make sure our brand and offerings continue to serve the mission we have always believed in:

_**Enabling all FinTech stakeholders to innovate at scale to further our common agenda of creating global economic impact.**_

If you are reading this note, you are already our partner in this mission. THANK YOU!

You have encouraged us to keep going when the road was uncharted, to change course when the approach wasn’t clear, to stop trying when the effort was futile. And most importantly, you’re the reason we continue to share the most accurate observations and insights every single day, rain or shine, during Christmas or Diwali, in hurricane or monsoon, with conviction in our mission and the trust of our audience (that’s you!).

This mission, which has always been at the heart of everything we do, is best served by consolidating our brand, insights, and products into a single name and a consolidated offering:

￼MEDICI represents our entire FinTech industry... the financial institutions; insurance companies; technology giants; established FinTech companies; 10,000\+ FinTech startups; hundreds of investors, accelerators, incubators, challenges, hackathons, events, innovation programs; and of course our 200,000\+ email subscribers and social media followers. Innovators from every FinTech segment around the world… all under the same tent, collaborating and inspiring the booming FinTech space.

Many of you have worked tirelessly alongside us to build this new industry together. Thank you!

It is our sincerest hope that this next chapter in our journey presents new opportunities for you to make your voice heard, your products known, and your impact felt across the FinTech landscape.

Best regards,
