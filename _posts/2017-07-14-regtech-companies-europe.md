In response to the severe need for efficient, tech-powered solutions, emerged one of the most <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outstanding segments in the FinTech industry</a> – regulatory technology, or RegTech. <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/21-hottest-regtech-startups-that-are-defining-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RegTech</a> refers to a set of companies and solutions that address regulatory challenges across industries, including financial services, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/regtech-cost-efficient-data-management-reporting-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">through innovative technology</a>. </p>

<p>As with many other segments in the FinTech industry, the lines differentiating an AI, Data Analytics, risk management, etc., startup and a RegTech startup are hardly strict given the technological nature of startups offering customized solutions across industries. </p>
