Let’s Talk Payments is dedicated to researching and examining the ideas, people, and companies using technology to change financial services.

The MEDICI Top 21 series has already seen tremendous traction with the two previous competitions: [MEDICI Top 21 Blockchain](https://letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-blockchain-awards-announcing-the-leaders-working-with-technology-of-the-future/) and the [MEDICI Top 21 InsurTech](https://letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-insurtech-announcing-the-21-leaders-among-the-480-identified-players/) respectively launched in May and August 2016.

Over 300\+ companies have been analyzed; after rigorous screening & evaluation by our [selected team of judges](https://letstalkpayments.com/scouting-top-21-ai-startups-transforming-finserv-value-chain-medici/) and our in-house experts, the LTP team is delighted to announce the Top 21 Winners – across three regions: EMEA, APAC, and the Americas.
