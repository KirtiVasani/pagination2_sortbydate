<p>Capitalism is a cultural construct as much as economic. In his talk, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karybheemaiah/">Kary Bheemaiah</a>, Head of Research at U Change, Associate Researcher &amp; Scientist at Cambridge Judge Business School, explains how capitalism has evolved over time and how we have blindly ended up outsourcing trust to the financial system at the expense of clarity. </p>

<p>Moving forward, Bheemaiah believes we need to delve further to find the right questions to ask and the right kind of interactions to have to bring back transparency and reduce inequalities in today’s society. And this is where the blockchain comes in.</p>
