Out of 50 companies ranked as the smartest in 2017 by MIT Review, 15 fall into the ‘well-known for invasive potential’ category of intelligent machines – IBM, Baidu, Intel, Microsoft, Apple, and the leader of the overall ranking, Nvidia. Biomedicine and Connectivity are the next largest groups with 11 and 10 companies in each respectively.

Connectivity is a particularly interesting bunch. Facebook, Salesforce, Alibaba, Tencent, Alphabet, and Amazon – all fall into this interesting group. All of them are building massive, super-integrated ecosystems, leaving little to no space for competition to cut off pieces of their businesses. Deep diversification and expansion into previously untapped lines of business are strengthening the positions of companies that thrive on the network effect.

In the vulnerability state, incumbents benefit from the continued presence of high barriers to entry such as regulation and capital requirements. But companies in this state often face increasing pressure to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs in their legacy businesses, and this pressure attracts opportunistic disruptors.

Consider the healthcare sector: Newer companies are entering the market with the embedded ability to use connected sensors and artificial intelligence to monitor the conditions of patients in real time – especially those suffering from chronic conditions. Meanwhile, an increasing numbers of incumbents are being compelled to adopt these technologies to stay competitive, even as cost and productivity pressures become acute.
