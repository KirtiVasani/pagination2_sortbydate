<p>Let’s Talk Payments (LTP) is a proud partner of this year’s Money20/20. Combining the best of LTP and Money20/20, we wanted to highlight the technologies changing the FinTech ecosystem. We created exclusive infographics based on <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/research-categories?kind=FinTech+Foresight">MEDICI’s FinTech Foresights</a>. </p>
<h2>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</h2>
<p>Financial institutions are held back by unproductive, repetitive manual processes. RPA presents a strong case to help promote digital transformation with its ability to drive productivity growth by automating repetitive, rule-based processes that can integrate with the current applications and systems in a non-invasive manner. This lightweight integration enables easy implementation and quick ROI.</p>
<p>RPA is expected to have a $6.7 trillion global economic impact, a plan that will result in a 40-45% growth of global spending on technology. In addition, the estimated global market potential of RPA stands at $8.75 billion by 2024, with the following areas undergoing significant impact:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bank office automation</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Finance &amp; accounting</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Risk management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">HR &amp; admin</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Procurement </li>
</ul>
