<p>It appears I haven’t fully realized that the future is here until the news on EEG being applied to reinvent shopping popped up. While it's still early – experimental – the approach is nothing short of outstandingly futuristic. More interestingly, it falls perfectly into the paradigm of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/payments-a-fading-experience/">fading physical experiences</a> in favor of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/understand-future-of-financial-services-industry/">invisible interfaces and processes</a> threading daily activities. </p>
<p>But my picks for today of news that's interesting are not only about the future of shopping knocking on our doors, they are also about the world’s firsts – the first government entity to adopt a DLT technology on a whole new level (a somewhat unexpected one), the first "user interface" layer for blockchain-based tokens creators, and the first AI supercomputer for fully autonomous robotaxis. Let’s have quick look:</p>
<h2>The Future of Shopping is Here! <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/10/10/ebay-launches-worlds-first-subconscious-shopping-experience/">eBay launches <b>"the world's first subconscious shopping experience"</b></a></h2>
<p>eBay teamed up with Saatchi Art to create an experimental shopping experience, which brings together art and technology to uncover shoppers' subconscious desires. </p>
<p>For 48 hours, the two retailers invited a select number of guests to attend a personalized shopping event, called "<a href="https://tamebay.com/2017/10/ebay-the-art-of-shopping-gives-retail-euphoria.html">The Art of Shopping</a>." Before entering a gallery filled with artworks, all guests were hooked up to headsets incorporating electroencephalogram (EEG) technology – which monitors electrical activity in the brain – supplied by tech company <a href="https://myndplay.com/">MyndPlay</a>. The technology was able to locate moments when the wearer was inspired by what they saw in front of them. It used this to create personalized shopping carts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-hattrell-168227b4/">Rob Hattrell</a>, VP of eBay UK, described the technology as <i>"the future of shopping."</i></p>
<p>The algorithm used to match customers with artworks was developed by behavioral psychologists. It is designed to be used with the billion items on sale on eBay's virtual marketplace.</p>
<p>The report investigated the difference between two types of buyers, 'shop-y-cats' who impulse-buy to fit in with trends, and 'inspired shoppers' who prefer to discover unique items. </p>

<h2><a href="http://mediaoffice.ae/en/media-center/news/7/10/2017/dubai-land-department.aspx">Dubai Land Department (DLD) becomes world’s first government entity to conduct all transactions through blockchain network</a></h2>
<p>DLD has created the Blockchain system using a smart and secure database that records all real estate contracts, including lease registrations, and links them with the Dubai Electricity &amp; Water Authority (DEWA), the telecommunications system, and various property related bills. Blockchain's secure, electronic real estate platform incorporates personal tenant databases, including Emirates Identity Cards and the validity of residency visas, and allows tenants to make payments electronically without the need to write cheques or print any papers. The entire process can be completed electronically within a few minutes at any time and from anywhere in the world, removing the need to visit any government entity.</p>
<p>Based on this initiative, DLD will be able to create a Blockchain database for all Dubai properties, which will be available to DLD’s customers as well as all of its government and private sector partners. The technology will allow investors residing in Dubai and around the world to verify property data that is backed by timestamp signatures, enhancing the accuracy of data, the credibility of investment transactions, and the transparency and clarity of the market.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blockchain-capital-and-taas-join-blockv-the-worlds-first-user-interface-for-blockchain-tokens-300533662.html">Blockchain Capital and TaaS Join BLOCKv, the World's First User Interface for Blockchain Tokens</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://blockv.io/">BLOCKv</a>, creators of the world's first "user interface" layer for blockchain-based tokens, announced two new prestigious contributors – <a href="http://blockchain.capital/">Blockchain Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.taas.fund/">Token-as-a-Service</a> (TaaS), the first-ever tokenized closed-end fund dedicated to blockchain assets. The contributions come just before BLOCKv's Token Generation Event (TGE) on October 12, when BLOCKv will release a network token, 'VEE,' with a target of $40 million in participations.</p>
<p>BLOCKv has created a blockchain-based development platform that enables the creation of smart, secure and dynamic virtual objects called vAtoms. The platform promises to usher in the next generation digital goods economy through the creation of a user interface layer that mitigates the complexity of blockchain development to unlock exponential growth. As sharable digital goods become more ingrained in the lives of consumers, BLOCKv technology provides an unprecedented opportunity for brands, marketers and developers to engage with and build stronger relationships with consumers.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3018880/nvidias-pegasus-is-the-worlds-first-ai-supercomputer-for-fully-autonomous-robotaxis">Nvidia's Pegasus is the 'world's first' AI supercomputer for fully-autonomous robotaxis</a> – Drive PX system will enable Level 5 driverless vehicles</h2>
<p>Nvidia has shown off the 'world's first' AI computer designed to power fully-autonomous 'robotaxis.' The new system, codenamed Pegasus, marks the first time that Nvidia's Drive PX platform has been capable of driving Level 5 driverless cars, which refers to vehicles that require no human control. Rather, Level 5 vehicles have full automation and don't require pedals, steering wheels, or controls for a human to take charge. </p>
<p>The Pegasus comprises of four AI processor, including two of Nvidia's latest generation Xavier models with embedded Nvidia Volta GPUs, with two next-generation discrete GPUs designed specifically to accelerate deep learning and computer vision.</p>
<p>The overall size of the system is roughly that of a license plate. <i>"Creating a fully self-driving car is one of society's most important endeavors – and one of the most challenging to deliver,"</i> said Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO. <i>"The breakthrough AI computing performance and efficiency of Pegasus is crucial for the industry to realize this vision. Driverless cars will enable new ride- and car-sharing services."</i>

<i>"New types of cars will be invented, resembling offices, living rooms or hotel rooms on wheels, Huang added. Travelers will simply order up the type of vehicle they want, based on their destination and activities planned along the way. The future of society will be reshaped,"</i> Huang said.

In the near term, Nvidia expects Pegasus to show up in shuttle vehicles in airports and on campuses, before arriving on public roads in the future. The platform will be available to early access partners in late-Q1 2018, and the firm claims it already has 25 companies signed up to develop fully self-driving taxis.</p>
