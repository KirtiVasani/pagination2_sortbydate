The year 2018 started off on a great note for the global FinTech community. In January 2018, FinTech startups across the globe collectively raised $2.56 billion in funding. The US heavily dominated the funding charts with $1.51 billion, which was a whopping 59% of the global FinTech funding in the first month of 2018.
