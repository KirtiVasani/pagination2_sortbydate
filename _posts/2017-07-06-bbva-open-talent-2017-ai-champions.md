<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/bbva-open-talent-2017-identity-challenge-champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Talent Identity champions</a>, the world’s biggest challenge for FinTech startups – <a href="https://www.centrodeinnovacionbbva.com/en/opentalent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBVA Open Talent 2017</a> – unveiled <a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/bbva-announces-change-winner-open-talent-artificial-intelligence-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the finalists for its 2017 Open Talent AI competitions</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27017" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/go-medici/uploads/2017/07/BBVA-2017-image.png" alt="BBVA Unveils the Champions of the Open Talent 2017 AI Challenge" width="562" height="136" />The<a href="http://www.centrodeinnovacionbbva.com/en/opentalent/competiciones/artificial-intelligence">BBVA Open Talent AI</a> competition was launched in March as part of BBVA’s wider Open Talent competition – the biggest FinTech competition in the world – which features challenges focused on AI, FinTech for Companies (F4C), Identity, Women in FinTech, Financial Inclusion, and specific challenges for <a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/bbva-announces-change-winner-open-talent-artificial-intelligence-competition/">11</a> countries around the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/bbva-announces-change-winner-open-talent-artificial-intelligence-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For the AI competition, BBVA had more than a hundred entries from 26 different countries</a>. Themes ranged from providing more personalized products and services, better risk management, offering customers greater insights into their transaction, personalized money management systems, and real-time AI chatbots.</p>
<p>BBVA judges selected <a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/bbva-announces-change-winner-open-talent-artificial-intelligence-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 best FinTech AI solutions</a> to take through to the final of the <a href="http://www.centrodeinnovacionbbva.com/en/opentalent/competiciones/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Talent AI challenge</a>, which was held at the end of June at Money 2020’s Arena Space in Copenhagen. The 10 finalists had each had five minutes to pitch their idea live to an audience of judges and fellow FinTech startups. From that pitch, the eventual winner was then selected, and as well as being announced on the main stage, also got to pitch their idea to the massive crowd – ensuring fantastic exposure. </p>
