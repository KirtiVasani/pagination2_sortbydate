<h4><strong>A moment of ‘weakness’ turned into an opportunity</strong> </h4>
<p>Financial technology startups can undoubtedly be credited with <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/what-makes-fintech-a-vital-element-of-the-international-ecosystem-infographic/">accelerating the pace of innovation adoption in the financial services industry</a>, and wealth management, in particular. As fairly noted by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wealth-wells-fargo-idUSKBN1671CS">Reuters</a>, companies like <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies/betterment">Betterment</a> and <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies/wealthfront">Wealthfront</a> have made robo-advisors, which provide automated investment advice to clients through web-based platforms, popular investing options, with which traditional brokerages rushed to compete, appreciating the opportunity to serve clients at lower costs enabled by technology. </p>
<p>To put things into perspective – <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/best-robo-advisors-2017-1?IR=T">fees charged by well-known players</a> like mentioned earlier Betterment, Wealthfront, Motif, and Folio, among others, range between <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/falgunidesai/2016/07/31/the-great-fintech-robo-adviser-race/#168038ba4a6f">15 to 35 basis points of AUM</a>, while traditional wealth management firms and financial advisers charge 1% of AUM or higher. The minimum investment requirements for getting into the game have played a significant role in the rapid expansion of the competition. <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">Technology startups</a> allowed more people, who otherwise may not be able to invest with confidence or meet account minimums, to enter the market in a passive fashion, professionals <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/falgunidesai/2016/07/31/the-great-fintech-robo-adviser-race/#168038ba4a6f">emphasize</a>.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/uncertain-future-of-wealthtech/">major product differentiation</a> that we have noted before is auto-rebalancing of the portfolio. Failure to re-evaluate a three-year-old investment in mutual funds and reallocation based on the latest market conditions may cause one a loss of an aggregate of <a href="http://blog.goalwise.com/how-is-goalwise-better-than-fundsindia-or-icici-direct-part-1/">1.5%-2%</a> in the long run. Not bothering to recalibrate may end up in losing a 2% of additional earnings that might have been prevented with the rebalancing of the portfolio. With robo-advising, auto rebalancing is taking care of that potential loss. </p>
<p>Having to adjust to emerging business models and technological advancements, traditional players <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/falgunidesai/2016/07/31/the-great-fintech-robo-adviser-race/2/#727d0b705213">initiated strategic moves</a> to learn as much and as fast as they can to pick up the pace of innovation adoption in the industry. </p>
<h4><strong>Financial institutions have learned their lesson</strong></h4>
<p>Today, it would certainly be an overstatement to announce a power sway in wealth management from institutional players to solutions offered by financial technology startups. And there are at least three important points to consider on the matter:</p>
<h6><strong>1. Sheer economics</strong></h6>
<p>First, <b>there always has been and is an enormous gap between AUM for financial institutions and the same for startups</b>, with institutions having accumulated significant resources (+data) in sheer numbers. For a better perspective, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/05/fintech-outlook-for-2016/">BofA, Morgan Stanley Wealth and JP Morgan altogether have $2.8 trillion AUM</a> (that's just three financial institutions), while some of the most successful FinTech alternatives to institutional divisions are nowhere close in terms of pure economics – Betterment and Wealthfront, for example, together have ‘only’ <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/betterment-vs-wealthfront/">$8.8 billion</a> AUM. Even if solutions offered by startups are yet superior technologically, that <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/whats-the-endgame-for-fintech/">gap is rapidly narrowing, if not gone</a>. </p>
<h6><strong>2. Embracing partnerships and in-house innovation</strong> </h6>
<p>Second, in the past year or so, <b>institutions have applied the lessons they learned to reboot the competition</b>. Some of the most powerful financial institutions stepped up their game in the segment. </p>
<p>Charles Schwab was one of the most interesting examples of a large institution that faced its emerging competition fiercely rather than succumbing to aggressive startups. As explained by <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3059565/how-charles-schwab-fought-back-against-the-robo-adviser-startups">Fast Company</a>, in June 2014, rather than leaving the robo-adviser idea to startups and hoping that it didn’t prove too disruptive, Schwab decided to face it head on with an offering of its own. The service it created, <a href="https://intelligent.schwab.com/">Schwab Intelligent Portfolios</a>, debuted the following March. While other robo-adviser services carry low fees, Schwab went a step ahead by not charging a fee at all for the service itself – it makes money from the fees investors pay for individual ETFs in their portfolios, and all portfolios include some cash managed by its Schwab Bank.</p>
<p>Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Edge discount brokerage unit is another of many vivid examples of a financial institution jumping into the fast-growing robo advisory business. The bank outlined <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/merrill-lynch-unveils-plans-to-launch-robo-adviser-1475610410">plans for Merrill Edge Guided Investing</a>, a new service meant to combine Merrill Edge’s online brokerage platform with Merrill Lynch’s human advisers’ wealth-management expertise. In starting its own robo service, Merrill entered a market pioneered by startups as a response to investors’ demand for low-cost advice in an era of low expected returns.</p>
<p>Other notable examples from the years 2016-17 include: </p>

</ul>
<p>The list is expected to grow as institutions pick up the pace of offering competitive solutions for previously unattended segments – whether through partnerships, or in-house innovation. As a result, even the most successful automated investment apps developed by financial technology startups should expect to face a competition like never before. </p>
<h6><strong>3. Banks will win in both parts of the new formula of success – human + robo-advisor</strong></h6>
<p>Finally, <b>financial institutions may have an upper hand in regaining dominant footing with all categories of customers as </b><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/debate-finally-ends-robo-advisors-vs-humans/"><b>Robo-Advisor + Human model</b></a><b> gradually proves to be the most winsome</b>. As we have <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/debate-finally-ends-robo-advisors-vs-humans/">noted</a> earlier this year, this new-found formula of success – robo-advisory laced with the human element – seems to be gaining traction with big companies and startups alike eager to incorporate the same into their offerings. </p>
<p>Why do institutions have an upper hand in this scenario? They have both elements sorted out – superior human element, nurtured through decades of experience in the space, and now, lessons applied to the technological side of the business.</p>
<p><i>“The “Robo” revolution which doesn’t have a lot of “robot” in it was very much needed to address a combination of high fees and low transparency in the investment industry. As solutions based around Artificial Intelligence mature, the next revolution will move from decision-trees workflow to dynamic analytics and recommendations catered to the individual needs and goals real-time,”</i> shared <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexmedana/">Alex Medana</a>, Founding Partner and CEO of <a href="http://www.finfabrik.com/">FinFabrik</a>. <i>“Until then, the hybrid model of “Human + Robot” brings the best of both worlds, i.e., the relationship, empathy, and trust of the human engagement improved by the analysis and calculation speed and power of the machines,”</i> he continued.</p>
