As the most powerful institutions are exploring ways to leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence, advanced technologies find their way into more trivial areas of everyday life. While AI is already present in consumer devices, some believe we are not so far away from the ubiquity of smartphones that are intelligent on a whole new level.

## Pick #1. AI Smartphones Will Soon Be Standard, Thanks to Machine Learning Chip

Today, smartphones that use machine learning depend on cloud servers which limit how information is processed. Having a built-in artificial intelligence processing unit, however, could change that and increase a device's computing power.

British chip design firm [ARM](https://www.arm.com/), the company behind virtually every chip in today’s smartphones, now wants to put the power of AI into every mobile device. Currently, devices that run AI algorithms depend on servers in the cloud. It’s a rather limited setup, with online connectivity affecting how information is sent back and forth.

[Project Trillium](https://www.arm.com/products/processors/machine-learning) would make this process much more efficient. [Their built-in AI chip](https://developer.arm.com/products/processors/machine-learning/arm-ml-processor) would allow devices to continue running machine learning algorithms even when offline. This reduces data traffic and speeds up processing, while also saving power.

## Pick #2. 3 Major Industries in Which Blockchain Technology Is Changing Life As We Know It

**Case 1. Music**

MedRec, an MIT-backed initiative designed to be a digital family history of medical records, uses blockchain to create for patients a family medical history that can be passed down from generation to generation. MedRec was implemented using Ethereum blockchain and uses that technology's smart contracts to execute scripts on the blockchain.

Smart contracts are “conflict-free” ways to exchange money, property, and shares or anything of value via blockchain. These contracts define the rules and penalties for each agreement and also enforce obligations automatically.

## Pick #3. WhatsApp UPI Beta Launch for 1 Million User Base, Low Per Transaction Limit: NPCI

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has given its consent to roll out the beta launch of WhatsApp BHIM UPI with a limited user base of 1 million and low per transaction limit.

Four banks will join the multi-bank BHIM UPI model in phases (in the coming weeks) and full feature product shall be released after the beta test is successful.
