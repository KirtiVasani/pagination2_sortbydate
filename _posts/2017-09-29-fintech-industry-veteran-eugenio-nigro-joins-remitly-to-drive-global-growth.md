<p><em>Remitly makes moves to expand its international footprint and influence as it brings on new global business development lead and opens office in Nicaragua.</em></p>
<p><strong>SEATTLE, September 27, 2017 —</strong> Today <a href="https://www.remitly.com/us/en/home/about_us">Remitly</a> announced its new Vice President of Global Business Development, Eugenio (Gene) Nigro. Nigro will drive the expansion of Remitly’s global footprint and influence as it continues to accelerate its growth, now transferring over $3 billion in annualized volume. The company also announced today its expanded physical footprint, opening an office in Nicaragua.</p>
<p><em>“Our goal is to bring transparency, security, and ease to people sending money to loved ones throughout the world,” </em>says Matt Oppenheimer, CEO of Remitly.<em> “Gene’s deep experience in the industry will be instrumental as we work to meet global demand and aggressively grow our global footprint. We’re excited to have him join the team.”</em></p>
<p>Nigro has more than 20 years experience in developing and implementing international strategic and tactical business development plans. For the past 10 years, Nigro worked for PayPal and Xoom where he led the Xoom business development function for Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Prior to Paypal’s acquisition of Xoom, he was Vice President of Business Development for Latin America, where he contributed to the company’s revenue growth and streamlined distribution channels.

<p>Nigro also held senior management roles at Western Union, where he developed the company’s presence in Latin America and country-specific strategic marketing, business, and product development plans.</p>
<p><em>“Remitly’s incredible commitment to helping hard-working immigrants send money across the world sets the company apart,” </em>said Nigro.<em> “That human-centric approach is essential when creating technology-driven solutions in our ever-changing, globally-connected world. This product provides not only ease and savings but also the confidence to both those sending money and those receiving it.”</em></p>
<p>Remitly’s new office, located in Nicaragua’s capital Managua, will open with 75 employees focused on customer service and risk operations for its rapidly expanding Latin American user base.
