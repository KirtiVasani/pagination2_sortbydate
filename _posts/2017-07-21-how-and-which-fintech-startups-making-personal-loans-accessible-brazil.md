<p>The very high-interest rates in Brazil are a problem that several startups are helping to solve.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.caixa.gov.br/Paginas/home-caixa.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caixa</a>'s payroll-deductible personal loan charges an average of <a href="http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/economia/noticia/2017-04/caixa-avalia-se-havera-reducao-de-juros-para-consignado-com-garantia-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3% interest</a> per month. Meanwhile, secured loan FinTech <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies/creditas">Creditas</a> is able to deliver an interest rate loan at <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/interview-with-sergio-furio-ceo-creditas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.15% a month</a> plus inflation, according to CEO <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/sergiofurio">Sergio Furio</a>.</p>
<p>Still, according to Furio, there is a large growth margin for the loan segment to grow in the country. The segment attracts the attention of investors, so much so that Creditas has already received more than R$90 million in contributions. <a href="https://www.bompracredito.com.br/new-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bom pra Crédito</a>, which has 1.5 million customers, received a contribution of R$6 million in June and, with this, intends to double its base.</p>
<h4><b>Margin for growth</b></h4>
<p>The largest banks still comprise the main source of loans in Brazil. Major retail banks accounted for 83% of all consumer loans in December 2016. Together, they accounted for 79% of payroll loans and 98% of mortgages, according to Goldman Sachs. In 2017, we have 33 <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FinTech companies competing in the credit area in Brazil</a>, according to <a href="http://fintechlab.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar FinTechLab</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most interesting startups providing personal loan FinTechs. Together, they have already lent more than $260 million.</p>

<h4><b>How FinTech startups in Brazil are able to offer lower interest rates</b></h4>
<p>FinTech's lower interest rate is achieved through technology.</p>
<p>The tools developed by startups make it possible to more accurately predict consumer behavior, reducing the risk of default, and preventing fraud.</p>
<p><i>"[Credit] valuation is one of Geru's differentials, with proprietary credit models that enable a complete view of multiple data sources,"</i> explained <a href="https://www.geru.com.br/emprestimos">Geru</a> CEO and Founder <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/sandro-reiss-350917">Sandro Reiss</a>. In this model, a partner bank acts in the formalization of the business, helping to meet regulatory requirements. </p>
<p>With these tools, a new path was opened in the credit market in Brazil, linking good payers to financial companies interested in offering credit with lower interest due to the lower risk.</p>
<p>The FinTechs that started operating a few years ago, such as Creditas in 2012, Bom pra Credito in 2013, and Geru in 2015, opened up an unexplored field. <i>"When we started operating we did not know how the Central Bank would interpret the operation we launched,"</i> said Reiss.</p>
<p>Today, the model is well accepted by the regulatory body. <i>"The Central Bank is playing its part, letting the business develop and follow-up to regulate at the right time."</i></p>
