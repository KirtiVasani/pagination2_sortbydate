<p><em>"The FinTech developments we've seen in Hong Kong since our inaugural </em><a href="http://www1.investhk.gov.hk/news-item/investhks-inaugural-hong-kong-fintech-week-showcases-citys-infrastructure-talent-and-business-friendly-culture/"><em>FinTech Week in November 2016</em></a><em> are phenomenal. They reflect the dynamic nature of the city and our strategic advantage of being right at the doorstep of China's vibrant FinTech scene,"</em> the Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenchristopherphillips/">Stephen Phillips</a>, said. <em>"And the beauty of FinTech in Hong Kong is that it's an organic ecosystem largely driven by the private sector. There are about 130 </em><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/hong-kong-fintech-ecosystem-startups-regulators-investors-accelerators/"><em>FinTech startups in Hong Kong</em></a><em>, we have four FinTech accelerators and the calendar is filled with more than 200 FinTech-related events here."</em></p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://fintechweek.hk/">Hong Kong FinTech Week Themes and Topics</a></strong></h2>

<p><em>"<strong>The theme of this year's HKMA FinTech Day is FinTech collaboration.</strong> Collaborations, both at domestic and cross-border levels, are the key to a sustainable FinTech ecosystem. The HKMA will unveil its domestic collaboration with the industry on its release of the second distributed ledger technology white paper and cross-border collaboration on trade-finance cooperation, and make known other collaborative initiatives on the FinTech Day. It is a must-go event for FinTech practitioners who want to keep abreast of the latest FinTech developments," </em>said Shu-pui Li, the Executive Director of the HKMA.</p>

<p>There will be abundant networking opportunities as the Week will bring together FinTech developers from Hong Kong, Mainland China and the rest of the world looking to grow their business here. Regulators, financial institutions and service providers will host "office hours" (one-on-one sessions) to guide and mentor entrepreneurs. Training workshops will offer tips on how to succeed in the FinTech business, and accelerators will hold competitions for startups.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Week, the Executive Director of Intermediaries Division of the SFC, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-leung-43943734/">Julia Leung</a>, said, <em>"Financial innovation is changing the way in which securities products and services are being delivered to investors.

<p><em>"Hong Kong has come to a crossroad where the baseline FinTech innovation infrastructure and awareness is here. Now, entrepreneurs and financial institutions have to take it to the next level and create products that consumers need," </em>said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juwanlee/">Juwan Lee</a>, the CEO &amp; Founder of NexChange.</p>
