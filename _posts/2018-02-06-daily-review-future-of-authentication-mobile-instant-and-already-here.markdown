Customer expectations are often running ahead of the available options, creating a gap for innovators to fill. In the financial services industry, the speed of service delivery without security and quality compromise became a cornerstone of the development of highly competitive alternatives to institutional portfolios.

A significant part of the global population lives in a [mobile-first world](https://letstalkpayments.com/we-live-in-a-mobile-first-world/), consuming (or at least performing) a research on a range of financial services on smartphones. Mobile will become a primary platform for payments and insurance businesses – some of the most successful technology companies are specifically tailoring their solutions for mobile devices to offer the best experience on a smartphone.

The shift towards mobile-first approach brings associated security reservations, and some FinTech companies are already ahead of the game, introducing instant authentication services on mobile in collaboration with a powerful party – a mobile operator.

## Pick #1. Payfone Partners with O2 to Thwart Digital Fraud, Continuing Expansion into 35 Global Markets

Payfone, the world’s leading digital identity authentication company, and UK mobile network operator O2 have signed a partnership contract to protect mobile users against cyber-hacks, account takeover attacks, SIM swap attacks, and other forms of digital fraud.

Payfone and O2 are launching this initiative to address the rapidly growing demand for mobile identity authentication services in UK and Europe.

## Pick #2. Banco Santander to Debut International Payment System on Ripple

Banco Santander has set a Q1 2018 launch date for the introduction of same-day, mobile, international payments for customers, which will operate using blockchain technology on Ripple’s distributed ledger.

Santander plans to introduce the service in four countries simultaneously and promises full transparency on fees and FX upfront. In November, the UK arm of the bank also announced plans to work with AmEx to use Ripple’s technology for cross-border, B2B payments.

> “We chose Ripple because of its speed, transparency, and certainty. These three characteristics provide relief to the pain points of international payments,” [said](http://www.paymenteye.com/2018/01/31/how-santander-will-use-ripple-to-execute-cross-border-payments/) Ed Metzger, Head of Technology Innovation at Santander UK.

## Pick #3. Why Microsoft Is Ruling The Cloud, IBM Is Matching Amazon, And Google Is $15 Billion Behind

2017 Cloud Revenue:

Microsoft – $18.6 billion

Amazon – $17.5 billion

IBM – $17.0 billion

Salesforce.com – $9.92 billion

Oracle – $5.6 billion

SAP – $4.7 billion

Google – $3 billion

What these numbers mean:

* Microsoft is the overall leader in the enterprise cloud.

* IBM is a huge winner on multiple fronts – its cloud business is within 10% of market leader Microsoft.

* Oracle and SAP are generating broad and deep growth for their cloud businesses and investing heavily in hybrid-cloud technologies to allow customers to continue to get maximum value out of their existing on-premises software in close collaboration with their new cloud services. Both companies are also investing heavily in customer-success programs essential to credibility in the cloud.

* Google Cloud Platform's achievement of $1 billion in Q4 revenue is outstanding – but it's also a clear indication that Google, for all of its astonishing technological and financial resources, has not until recently taken this market seriously. Now that Diane Greene and company have things on track, it will be most interesting to see how GCP fares in the Cloud Wars in 2018 and beyond.
