<p><a href="http://www.ewise.com">eWise</a>, a leading international provider of financial data aggregation and data analytics APIs, is now giving free access to Categorisation-as-a-Service (CaaS) API, allowing early-stage developers to quickly test their business solutions.</p>
<p>eWise <a href="http://www.ewise.com/categorisation-as-a-service">CaaS</a> automatically categorizes users’ financial transactions. It is available as a standalone API that can be integrated directly within the developer’s app or can be connected with eWise <a href="http://www.ewise.com/aegis">Aegis</a> data aggregation platform.</p>
<p>eWise CaaS is a truly international service, understanding transaction descriptions in a variety of languages. The categorization process is independent of where the transaction comes from and applicable in any country around the world.</p>
<h4><strong>A personalized experience through user-assisted categorization</strong></h4>
<p>eWise understands through experience that auto-categorization can never be 100% accurate using a fully automated artificial intelligence tool. Machine learning models have a degree of error, spend attribution can be extremely personal and eWise CaaS turns these attributes into a powerful feature. “Assisted Categorisation” allows users to control their preferences and works in collaboration with auto-categorization to maximise categorization accuracy.</p>
<h4><strong>Free testing environment to build innovative solutions and proof-of-</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>oncepts</strong></h4>
<p>The eWise <a href="http://www.ewise.com/caas-api-subscription">CaaS FREE package</a> will give three months live access to the eWise CaaS API and comprehensive API documentation. No setup fee and transaction fees are applicable during the trial period. To qualify for this FREE program, businesses have to be in the process of developing a product that has not gone live. After the free trial period of three months, businesses can upgrade to the PRO or ENTERPRISE plan, details are available on eWise's website.</p>
<p>This package is designed to allow early stage developers to quickly gain momentum before building their solution.</p>
<p>eWise CaaS is part of a global strategy at eWise, opening up an ecosystem of <a href="http://www.ewise.com/api-services">API services</a> and SDKs to developers, leveraging eWise expertise in data aggregation, transaction categorization, cash flow forecasting, spend and income analysis.</p>
