Ant Financial found through data analysis that young women who like tight jeans have their phone screens replaced more frequently. It then launched "screen insurance" targeting the demographic, China Daily Reports.

## Pick #1. Alibaba's Ant Financial Using Artificial Intelligence to Advance

The "smart customer service," a system launched in 2015 for automated customer calls, has recently surpassed human performance in terms of customer satisfaction.

AI is an important technology that generates value from data. The company has also utilized machine learning technology to launch an image recognition system to aid vehicle insurance claims. The AI damage-assessment system allows users to take a photo of the vehicle's exterior damage with their smartphones and send it to the insurance company. The system will then enable the insurance company to assess the extent of the damage, and list nearby repair shops and their different prices to fix the damage.

Exterior damage claims comprise about 60% of the 45 million private-vehicle insurance claims filed in China each year.
