<h4><b>Expectations from applicants and startups </b></h4>
<p>Criteria include traction, idea, team, market size, competition, but there is no fixed formula, as the organization emphasizes. The selection panel – comprised of some of the top people from the financial services industry – will be the judge and jury.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/innovation-programmes/isme-ace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACE</a> does not exclude startups at any stage from participating in the program – it's open to inducting startups ranging from idea level to well-funded startups.</p>
<p>The expectation from startups is the ability to work full-time with <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/innovation-programmes/isme-ace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACE</a> at its campus in Lower Parel or at the program partner AWFIS (outside Mumbai) – all co-founders should be full-time and committed to the startup. International startups will have the option to work remotely once selected. However, if convenient, working from Mumbai will be a lot more beneficial for obvious reasons. Pitching, mentoring and other sessions will be conducted online if international startups are working out of their base location.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>The last date for </b><a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/innovation-programmes/isme-ace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>application</b></a><b> is July 25, 2017.</b></p>
