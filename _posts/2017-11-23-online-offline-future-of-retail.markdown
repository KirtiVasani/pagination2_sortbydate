<p>Contrary to the widespread belief that physical retail is widely believed to be playing a diminishing role in modern lifestyle, the future of commerce will be at the intersection of online and offline worlds. Amazon + Whole Foods, and now Alibaba + Sun Art are defining the winning strategy in global commerce.</p>
<h2>Chinese online shopping giant Alibaba pins its hopes on physical stores as it buys hypermarket chain for £2.2 billion
</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba will buy a 36% stake in Sun Art as it tries to cash in on China's $500 billion food retail sector.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2015, Alibaba has invested around £7 billion in physical stores.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The move follows Amazon's £10.3billion purchase of Whole Foods earlier this year, allowing the organic grocery chain to cut prices on its best-selling staple products and begin a delivery service for customers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>No longer brick-and-mortar vs. online retail: Customers view a ‘single lens’
</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the ease of online shopping, consumers still crave the tactile experience of physical stores.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than pitting the two channels against each other, retailers can secure a much larger wallet share by giving consumers the best of both worlds through the adoption and use of new technologies.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">By offering complimentary benefits, as well as engaging customers via mobile, both in-store and online retailer channels can strengthen overall customer engagement and brand affinity. And the best news for retailers taking an integrated approach: higher revenues and profitability.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Examples: Amazon + Whole Foods, Walmart + Bonobos, Walmart + ModCloth. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The “look before you buy” experience requires a certain level of physical presence. Examples: Casper + Target partnership, Amazon’s Prime Wardrobe, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Online comes together with offline through various beneficial strategies: added offline incentives based on online purchases, payment perks, a more personal customer experience offline integrated with rapid inventory availability online. Examples of blended omnichannel strategy: Best Buy, Home Depot, etc.</li>
</ul>
