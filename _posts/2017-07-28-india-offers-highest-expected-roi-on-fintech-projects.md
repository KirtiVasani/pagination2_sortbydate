<h4><b>2017 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for FinTech globally</b></h4>
<p>The year 2017 is a pivotal year for <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">the FinTech community around the world</a> as <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/understand-future-of-financial-services-industry/">external forces significantly affect the underlying technology and market trends</a>. Despite courageous efforts, years of aggressive growth and infinite expansion of product/service variety within limited national borders, behemoths like IBM (<a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/">IBM Q</a>), Amazon (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011">Amazon Go</a>), Alibaba (<a href="http://mashable.com/2017/07/12/taobao-china-store/">Tao Cafe</a>), Apple, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/starbucks-the-unlikely-winner-in-mobile-payments/">Starbucks</a>, and Alphabet, have such a tremendous influence of how the financial technology space will develop that in the years ahead, the startup community may look dramatically different. </p>
<p>As much as the ongoing change (emerging business models; <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/initial-coin-offerings-icos/">funding strategies</a>; acquisitions – <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-05/big-banks-poised-to-scoop-up-fintech-startups-report-finds">~50%</a> of financial services firms around the world plan to acquire FinTech startups in the three to five years; partnerships – <a href="https://www.startupbootcamp.org/blog/2017/07/fintech-india-trends-report-2017/">&gt;95%</a> of financial services incumbents are seeking to explore FinTech partnerships through collaboration; etc.) affects the startup community, there is another part of the ecosystem heavily dependent on market trends: <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/83-fintech-vc-firms-to-consider-if-you-are-a-fintech-startup-raising-money/">venture capital firms</a>, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/88-international-startup-accelerators-incubators-innovation-labs-nurturing-innovators-in-financial-services/">accelerators, incubators</a>, or any other type of a FinTech investor. Investors and other vested parties are continuously scouting the world for the most promising project (through <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/bbva-open-talent-2017-ai-champions/">BBVA Open Talent</a>, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/innovators-citi-t4i-challenge-213-teams-34-countries/">Citi T4I</a>, <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/apply-for-isme-ace-indias-largest-fintech-accelerator/">ISME ACE</a>, to name a few), and some markets hold a greater promise for ROI on FinTech investments than other. </p>
<h4><b>Markets that have the highest expected annual ROI in FinTech investments</b></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.startupbootcamp.org/blog/2017/07/fintech-india-trends-report-2017/">FinTech India Trends Report 2017</a> unveiled at the end of July 2017, suggests that India offers the highest expected annual ROI on FinTech investments – 29% versus the global average of 20%. Moreover, even as a region, Asia offers a lower average ROI than India – 25%. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, North America stands at 23% and Latin America at 22% ROI. Interestingly, Europe is expected to offer the lowest ROI on FinTech investments – 14%. </p>

<h4>Why India offers the highest expected ROI on FinTech projects</h4>
<p><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/relationship-indian-banks-fintech-startups-2017/">Partnerships with FinTech companies in India</a> are expected to go up from 42% in 2016 to 95% this year on average. Among the reasons for high expectation from the Indian market are strong governmental support and certain funding trends. </p>
<p>Professionals outline <a href="https://www.startupbootcamp.org/blog/2017/07/fintech-india-trends-report-2017/">six methods used by Indian financial institutions to work with FinTech startups</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Supplementary Offerings (using new or existing subsidiaries or sub-brands to offer new services)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Partnerships (develop solutions together with FinTech companies)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Acquisitions (enhancing their value chain by onboarding proven FinTech companies)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Incubating (running startup programs to incubate companies relevant to their market)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Investing (setting up venture funds to invest in FinTech companies)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bridge-Makers (bridging the gap between innovation demand and supply by curating the best ventures to meet enterprise needs, deploy innovation at scale, and manage change)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.startupbootcamp.org/blog/2017/07/fintech-india-trends-report-2017/">report on FinTech India trends</a> suggests that strong, proactive policy level support from the government has been providing a much-needed boost to user adoption. Initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (<a href="https://pmjdy.gov.in/">PMJDY</a>), IndiaStack, <a href="https://uidai.gov.in/">Aadhaar</a> and the emergence of <a href="http://www.npci.org.in/UPI_Documents.aspx">UPI</a> provide a good foundation for FinTech companies to pervade ‘last-mile’ touchpoints and boost <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/regulating-digital-financial-services-to-promote-financial-inclusion/">financial inclusion</a> across the country. </p>
<p>Moreover, despite significant reductions in incoming global investments in the FinTech space, the India opportunity remains promising. Experts emphasize that India offers the largest unbanked or underbanked population, along with a strong technology and entrepreneurial ecosystem. The <a href="https://www.startupbootcamp.org/blog/2017/07/fintech-india-trends-report-2017/">report</a> suggests that while the global FinTech community saw a drop in funding from $14.6 billion in 2015 to $12 billion in 2016, FinTech investments in Asia increased to $5.4 billion in 2016, up 12.5% from $4.8 billion in 2015, driven mainly by China and India. </p>
<p>Estimates from a different <a href="https://yourstory.com/2017/02/vc-investment-in-india-fintech-decline-to-216-million-in-2016-dipped/">study</a> published earlier this year indicate a similar story – despite the decline, India appears to be a key focus of VC investors in Asia. The demonetization efforts of Q4 2016 resulted in an increase in transactions for both payments companies and mobile wallet providers.</p>
