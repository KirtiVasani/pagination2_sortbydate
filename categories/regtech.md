The ever-changing dynamics of the FinTech space has increasingly brought regulations under the focus. The RegTech segment consists of technology platforms which help startups/incumbents to comply with regulations. These platforms keep track of the changing regulations, identify the risks and highlight the potential non-compliance areas well ahead in time. The major focus areas in RegTech include Governance, risk and compliance.
