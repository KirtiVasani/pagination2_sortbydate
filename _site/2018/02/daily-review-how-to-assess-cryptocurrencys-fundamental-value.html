<p>After a successful 2017 pilot program, <a href="https://www.idemia.com/">IDEMIA</a>, a company claiming to be a leader in Augmented Identity for a digital world, and the Alabama Department of Revenue have announced the full-scale deployment of the electronic ID app (<a href="https://www.alabamaeid.com/">Alabama eID</a>) to protect residents against state income tax refund theft.</p>

<p>The Alabama eID app is available for download in the App Store and Google Play. Users complete a short registration process in which their identities are verified by scanning their physical driver’s license or state-issued ID and taking a selfie with their smartphone. This information is compared against the data and photo on record in the driver’s license database to verify that the person registering for the app is who they claim to be.</p>

<p>With the Alabama eID, there are no usernames or passwords to remember, and only the user can authorize the Department of Revenue to process his/her state income tax refund.</p>

<p>Using facial recognition technology, the Alabama eID verifies a person’s identity by matching his/her face against the picture used to make one’s driver’s license or state-issued ID.</p>
