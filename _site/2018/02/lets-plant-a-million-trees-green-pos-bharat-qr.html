<p>It was in February 2017 that the Indian payments industry under the guidance of the Reserve Bank and the Government of India launched <a href="http://meity.gov.in/bharat-qr-code">Bharat QR</a>, the world’s first interoperable Quick Response (QR) code acceptance solution. Being QR-led it allows for low-cost acceptance and highly secure push payments (consumer initiated) transaction. With increasingly affordable data price and the rapid adoption of smartphones, Bharat QR clearly allows everyone to be a digital payment-accepting merchant. However, it is the green part of it that deserves special mention.</p>

<p>The cost of a physical POS terminal ranges from Rs. 3,000 ($47) for a mobile POS to Rs. 12,000 ($188) for a GPRS device. The hardware, which is largely imported, generates significant e-waste and requires a constant supply of paper rolls and maintenance. For a country of more than 90 million retailers, this represents a significant cost not just in terms of import bill, but also the environmental cost of managing this e-/paper waste.</p>

<p>In contrast, Bharat QR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>is just a sticker (decal) pasted on the teller counter wall of the merchant;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>doesn’t need any maintenance;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>can be generated dynamically on the merchant’s mobile itself, removing the need for printing, which results in practically zero e-waste and paper loss.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On top of it, Bharat QR provides significant benefits to both consumers and merchants.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-bharat-qr-pos-for-small-merchants">The benefits of Bharat QR POS for small merchants</h2>

<p>One of the key hindrances in the adoption of digital payments by small merchants with a monthly turnover less than Rs. 100,000 (~$1,570) is the monthly rental cost of a POS device. In comparison, Bharat QR provides low-cost acceptance, increasing the possibility of adoption – practically everyone can be a merchant with Bharat QR.</p>

<p>Greater digital cash flow opens the opportunity to obtain cash flow financing at attractive rates directly from financial institutions. Being a push payment solution, it incrementally reduces the transaction risk, helping banks in underwriting smaller merchants.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-bharat-qr-pos-for-consumers">The benefits of Bharat QR POS for consumers</h2>

<p>With the mobile phone becoming a focal point of daily life, Bharat QR provides an exciting possibility of consolidating both physical and online purchases. As a single interoperable standard, it enhances and catalyzes the consumer adoption journey, both from functional and actual user-led adoption points of view.</p>

<p>Additionally, being a push payment solution, it provides enhanced security to the consumer.</p>

<p>In both cases, the availability of digital transaction records reduces the need to opt for physical statements.</p>

<h2 id="the-environmental-burden-of-pos-systems">The environmental burden of POS systems</h2>

<p>In the year between 10/16/2016 to 10/17/2017, RBI reported the following stats on merchant transactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Indians performed 1.32 billion transactions on credit cards;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.35 billion transactions on debit cards;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the above resulted in 93.5 million of paper rolls. On an average, each roll amounts to 50 prints (customer + merchant copy). If we were to include domestic prepaid transactions, this would amount to 100 million paper rolls every year.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is the cost to the environment with just 3 million merchants (approx. 100% increase from 10/16/2016) on board. It isn’t difficult to imagine the impact and cost to the environment with 90 million merchants. Adding to that the fact that typical a POS machine’s shelf life is three to four years, the cost to environment gets even gloomier.</p>

<p>By providing the Bharat QR option to merchants, the government is taking responsible steps towards a greener and a more sustainable future. Currently, it takes $10 on average to acquire a merchant. In the past, the government has supported greener initiatives by providing a subsidy for their adoption. If the government were to provide a 50% subsidy on acquisition costs for new businesses with &lt;$2 million turnover and 1% green input credit in GST to merchants with &lt;$2 million turnover, it will undoubtedly lead to Bharat QR’s rapid adoption.</p>

<p>The Reserve bank of India, recognizing the importance of digital acceptance solutions (more secure, low cost, near-zero maintenance), provided an MDR advantage of 10 BPS (though it is not relevant now considering the government is absorbing the cost for next two years) over physical POS terminals.</p>

<p>In China, Kenya, and Sweden, the rapid adoption of digitization was supported by mobile-based methods of payment and acceptance. It’s high time we join the bandwagon towards such solutions as they come with a greener side to them, which is a highly appealing advantage.</p>
