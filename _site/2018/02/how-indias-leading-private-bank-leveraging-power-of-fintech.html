<p>Innovation in financial services is critical to meet the growing demands of new-age customers. The new generation of customers are well aware of their needs and prefer a solution that is not only user-friendly and intuitive, but efficient.</p>

<p>The focus on banking innovation with an emphasis on digitization has been at the forefront ever since the advent of smartphones and Internet. According to McKinsey, banks who adopt a strong digitization strategy are able to increase their sales and revenues by 4% to 16% through enhanced customer relationship management and increased product cross-selling. Changing consumer behavior and preferences forced financial institutions to adjust the delivery of services across channels to ensure seamless experiences.</p>
