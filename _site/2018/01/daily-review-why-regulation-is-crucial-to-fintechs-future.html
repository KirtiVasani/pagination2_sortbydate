<p>China’s FinTech industry has seen Ponzi schemes and weak business models, and that about 100 online wealth management platforms in China went out of business in 2015-2016.

It also went after FinTech firms that offered excessive and unsustainable returns.</p>

  <p>“Many of the new financial systems don’t have the safeguards,” said Edward Hartman, Co-founder of LegalZoom, who is also the entrepreneur-in-residence at Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners, a global consulting firm, listing another area of concern. “And they’re enormously powerful.” He added that while FinTechs bring financial inclusion, regulation and oversight are essential to protect investors. “It’s freedom that comes at a price.”</p>
