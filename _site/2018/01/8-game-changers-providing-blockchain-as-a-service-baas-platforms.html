<p>With an increasing number of enterprises expressing interest in distributed ledger technology, tech companies are rushing to meet the demand. To democratize blockchain technology, Microsoft, IBM, Deloitte, and now Baidu and Tencent, have developed their own platforms offering blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS). Let’s look at three examples of BaaS solutions taking enterprise-grade experimentation with blockchain to a whole new level.</p>

<h2 id="baidu-blockchain-open-platform">Baidu Blockchain Open Platform</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/search-giant-baidu-launches-blockchain-as-a-service-platform/">Coindesk</a>, on January 12, Chinese web search giant <a href="https://chain.baidu.com/">Baidu has launched its own Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform</a>. Based on technology developed by Baidu, the <a href="https://chain.baidu.com/">open platform</a> sets out to provide the most “user-friendly” blockchain service. <a href="https://trust.baidu.com/vstar/official/index/">Baidu Trust</a> allows the conducting and tracing of transactions; it can be applied in various use cases, including digital currency, digital billing, bank credit management, insurance management financial auditing, and more. The company says the technology has already been applied in asset securitization &amp; exchange, and claims it has contributed to the “first asset-backed securities exchange products using blockchain technology in China.”</p>

</ul>

<p>According to the press release, Oracle plans to offer Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service as part of Oracle Platform for Open Banking, and provide seamless connectivity between Oracle FLEXCUBE and other banks to enable greater security, scalability, and transparency in the information exchanged.</p>

<h2 id="hewlett-packard-enterprise-blockchain-as-a-service">Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Blockchain-as-a-Service</h2>

<p>In November 2017, Hewlett-Packard <a href="https://news.hpe.com/hewlett-packard-enterprise-introduces-blockchain-as-a-service-solution-for-enterprises/">announced</a> the first product in the HPE Mission Critical Blockchain family. Mission Critical Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a solution that enables customers to run distributed ledger workloads on the highest availability enterprise platforms.</p>

<p>According to the official press release, the Mission Critical DLT solution is a part of HPE’s overall approach to bring an enterprise-grade capability to blockchain workloads. The solution is offered on <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers/nonstop.html">HPE Integrity NonStop platforms</a>, which process two out of every three credit card transactions in the world. It was developed in partnership with enterprise software firm R3, integrating the company’s distributed ledger technology with HPE’s Mission Critical platform. This combination enables customers to execute distributed-ledger workloads in environments that demand 100% fault tolerance at mission-critical levels and ensures massive scalability to grow with the business as well as SQL integration with legacy systems.</p>

<h2 id="ibm-blockchain-platform">IBM Blockchain Platform</h2>

<p><a href="https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/blockchain">The IBM Blockchain Platform</a> is a fully integrated blockchain platform designed to accelerate the development, governing, and operation of a multi-institution business network. The platform allows to develop an application, govern and operate the network.</p>

<p>The Enterprise Membership Plan includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Access to the network’s transaction ordering service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A highly available certificate authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A network peer, running in a highly secure environment, isolated from other members’ environments (additional peers can be purchased for high availability)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coming soon: Cryptographic keys stored in a hardware security module (HSM); certified to FIPS 140-2 Level 4 – the highest in the industry.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Enterprise Plan meets production requirements including security and performance for regulated industries.</p>

<p>IBM Blockchain Platform is not the only way IBM is involved in powering distributed networks. In February 2016, IBM made nearly 44,000 lines of code available to the Linux Foundation’s open-source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger Project</a> to help developers easily build secure distributed ledgers that can be used to exchange almost anything of value. Launching the new service, IBM was intended to help developers create and manage blockchain networks to power a new class of distributed ledger applications.</p>

<p>IBM has <a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49029.wss">listed</a> unique capabilities the new service brings, among which are pluggable architecture to allow developers use software modules (consensus module for example) that best suits their needs, a new consensus algorithm developed by IBM Research tailored to specific blockchain use cases, advanced identity management built with the latest cryptography, smart contracts that can be written in popular programming languages such as Java or Golang and executed in containers, and fine-grained privacy and confidentiality control, which allows authors of smart contracts to precisely specify both who can view them and who can execute them.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-blockchain-on-azure">Microsoft Blockchain on Azure</h2>

<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/">Microsoft Blockchain on Azure</a> is an application development platform from Microsoft with a set of solution templates that deploy and configure client’s choice of blockchain network with minimal Azure and blockchain knowledge.</p>

<p>With a handful of user inputs and a simple single-click deployment through the Azure portal, clients can provision a fully configured blockchain network topology in minutes, using Microsoft Azure compute, networking, and storage services across the globe. Microsoft has automated these time-consuming pieces to allow clients to focus on building out scenarios and applications. Clients are only charged for the underlying infrastructure resources consumed, such as compute, storage, and networking. There are no incremental charges for the solution itself.</p>

<p>The platform has two software plans:</p>

<p>Ethereum Consortium Blockchain: This solution deploys an Ethereum simulated multi-member network, consisting of a set of load-balanced transaction nodes with which an application or user can interact to submit transactions and a set of mining nodes to record transactions. It can take between 5-20 minutes to provision, depending on the size of the network. Once complete, through the administrator web page, you can configure additional Ethereum accounts to get started with smart contract, and eventually application, development. The URL for the administrator web page is the first output of the deployment.</p>

<h2 id="sap-cloud-platform-blockchain-service">SAP Cloud Platform Blockchain Service</h2>

<p>In May 2017, SAP <a href="https://news.sap.com/sapphire-now-sap-cloud-platform-blockchain-service/">revealed</a> its cloud-based blockchain service <a href="https://news.sap.com/sapphire-now-new-sap-leonardo-digitally-transform-at-scale/">SAP Leonardo</a>.

<h2 id="tencent-in-development">Tencent (in development)</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/internet-giant-tencent-blockchain-platform/">Coindesk</a> reported in April 2017, Tencent is building a suite of blockchain services, detailing the plans in a new white paper. The firm is planning to use the technology to offer digital asset management, authentication and “shared economies,” among others services. The <a href="https://trustsql.qq.com/chain_oss/index_gw.html">platform</a> called “TrustSQL” is envisioned as a three-part system, incorporating the core chain layer, a product and service layer, and an application layer.</p>

<p>In statements, Tencent said that it would leverage its technological resources to push the platform and that it sees the project as an open-ended one that encourages collaboration with other firms.</p>
