<h2 id="what-is-property-technology-proptech-and-why-is-it-important">What is property technology (PropTech) and why is it important?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The makings of PropTech began in the mid-1980s, marked by the founding of companies that provided software for the commercial real estate industry. Autodesk and NCREIF in 1982, Yardi in 1984, and CoStar in 1987. However, PropTech didn’t really spring to life in a big way until the mid-2000s, when cloud computing, broadband connectivity, and mobile devices enabled residential PropTech giants RightMove, Trulia &amp; Zillow to launch and show investors the value of disrupting real estate through technology. Since the mid-2000s, more and more PropTech startups have been bringing new technologies to market that address a wide variety of inefficiencies, scoring more attention and capital from technology VCs and growth funds, which legitimizes the real estate technology movement,” explained Nathan Dever, the Founder of <a href="https://www.ten-x.com/">Ten-X</a>, a real estate platform that allows buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to search, list and transact properties completely online, summing up <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bisnow/2017/11/17/the-beginners-guide-to-commercial-real-estate-tech-what-exactly-is-proptech/#360a13c75239">the making of property technology(PropTech)</a>.</p>

<p>PropTech encompasses a variety of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/10/the-impending-opportunity-in-real-estate-technology/">areas</a>, including property management using digital dashboards, research &amp; analytics, listing services/tech-enabled brokerages, mobile applications, residential &amp; commercial lending, 3D-modeling for online portals, and many more. <a href="http://gpti.de/blog/2016/08/19/what-is-proptech-a-brief-history/">German PropTech Initiative</a> adds to the applications crowdfunding real estate projects, shared spaces management, as well as organizing, analyzing, and extracting key data from lengthy rental documents.</p>

<p>One of the areas that have been affected the most by data-focused platforms is the search and discovery of properties. Results of a study by HSBC called <a href="https://www.us.hsbc.com/home-loans/products/beyond-the-bricks/">Beyond the Bricks</a> found that over four in five (86%) of recent homeowners looked for available properties online and a similar proportion (85%) searched online for house prices. Some 82% went online to help research where they would like to live. Online marketplaces for real estate are the most common representatives of the PropTech business, which will soon have two important implications: first, the organic expectation of the modern consumer to be able to find relevant real-time listings online in a friendly interface, and second, the necessity for businesses to go an extra mile – integrate predictive analytics for estate pricing, life-like 3D models for virtual tours, incorporation of financial instruments like insurance, payments management, and a lot more.</p>

<p>At the moment, however, the industry is still in the early stages of filling out the value chain of the real estate business – the services are yet to see consolidation into mega-platforms. It is apparent, however, that the opportunities are vast with advancements in machine learning, IoT, sensory technology, and a pivot towards smart nations, smart cities and smart buildings by the most advanced authorities. More importantly, PropTech feeds on the increased mobility of a modern global citizen – the technology sector is bound to address accelerating changes in the way individuals and businesses discover, buy/sell, and manage property.</p>

<p><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/real-estate/articles/commercial-real-estate-industry-outlook.html">Commercial Real Estate Outlook 2018</a> by Deloitte reports that globally, the number of real estate tech startups rose from 176 in 2008 to 1,274 by 2017. In the same period, cumulative investments in these startups soared from $2.4 billion to $33.7 billion.</p>

<p>While venture capital remains the dominant funding source, there is substantial capital flow from non-VC investors as well, including REITs (real estate ITs), established real estate services companies and investors, private equity firms, and high-net-worth individuals. Deloitte predicts that in the five-year period between 2011 and 2016, funding from non-VC sources for real estate tech startups increased at a CAGR of 65.7% to $2.3 billion in 2016. As of September 2017, funding hit an all-time-high record of $5.8 billion YTD.</p>

<h2 id="how-technology-changes-the-real-estate-business">How technology changes the real estate business</h2>

<p>PropTech is expected to reshape and redefine the real estate industry, from how we buy, sell or rent properties to how we manage them, be they shopping malls, hospitals, wellness facilities or golf courses, professionals <a href="http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tech-proptech-%E2%80%94-disruptor-and-future-property-industry">suggest</a>. Advances in technology are breaking the traditional process of companies and individuals making real estate-related decisions – how to discover, review, buy, sell, lease estate. The process has always been controlled and defined by the industry; more particularly, by the largest real estate conglomerates – think <a href="http://www.kw.com/kw/">Keller Williams Realty</a>, <a href="https://www.weichert.com/">Weichert</a>, <a href="https://www.century21.com/">Century21</a>, <a href="https://www.remax.com/">RE/MAX</a>, <a href="https://www.coldwellbanker.com/">Coldwell Banker</a>, <a href="https://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng">Sotheby’s International Realty</a>, <a href="http://www.keyes.com/">The Keyes Company</a>, and others. We can probably add <a href="http://www.zillow.com">Zillow </a>(<a href="http://www.trulia.com">Trulia</a> belongs to Zillow Group Brands) to the list of the largest players, although it does represent a new generation of tech-focused real estate businesses.</p>

<p>Data source: <a href="https://researchgateway.cbre.com/Layouts/GKCSearch/DownLoadPublicUrl.ashx">How technology will redefine real estate, and why companies need to prepare now, CBRE, 2017</a></p>

<p>Digital technologies are reshaping the way individuals and businesses are fulfilling their RE needs. One of the most important catalysts of change is the smartphone, <a href="https://manage.cbre.com/">CBRE</a>, one of the largest commercial real estate services and investment firm in the world, suggests. With penetration of nearly 60% in Asia-Pacific, for example, mobile phones are the primary means by which many people collect information, approach customers, and dispatch services.</p>

<p>In its 2017 report called <a href="https://www.cbre.com/research-and-reports/2017-apac-twj-reports">How Technology Will Redefine Real Estate</a><em>,</em> CBRE emphasizes that technology is already enabling individual mobility when it comes to the physical place of work, all while fostering a more creative and sharing culture within companies, business units, and individual teams. This is supporting the use of third-party spaces such as co-working centers and serviced offices – a relatively young, but massive industry, which is the most receptive to PropTech innovations.</p>

<p>Some technologies will have a stronger transformative impact on the development of PropTech than others. <a href="http://www.forty8developments.co.uk/">Forty/8</a>, a specialist property company, sees the benefit of using VR to help potential buyers visualize finished apartments at a development in Manchester, the Telegraph <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connect/better-business/innovation/how-property-sector-is-using-tech-to-innovate/">reports</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“On traditional opening weekends, we expect to sell about 7pc of apartments on show, but using the VR headsets has seen sales increase to 15pc,” says Richard Forman, Head of Sales. “VR headsets enable viewers to step inside the apartment and sense how it will look and feel. It gives them a better understanding of what’s on offer.”</p>
