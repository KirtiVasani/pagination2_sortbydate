<p>Being denied an opportunity to buy an entrance ticket into the US market, Ant Financial nonetheless finds a way to establish a channel for future endeavors with MoneyGram. This collaboration is as meaningful of a move from one of the Chinese dragons, as an acquisition would be, identifying a very serious intention to finally cross the US border.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-ant-financial-and-moneygram-form-strategic-partnership-after-proposed-12m-merger-deal-fails">Pick #1. Ant Financial and MoneyGram form strategic partnership after proposed $1.2M merger deal fails</h2>

<p>With the merger off the table, MoneyGram and Ant Financial have instead formed a “strategic business cooperation” with plans to work together to develop strategic initiatives in the remittance and digital payments markets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Companies will collaborate to “provide their respective customers with user-friendly, rapid-response and low-cost money transfer services in China, India, and the Philippines, among other Asian markets, as well as in the US and other key regions around the world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Establishing this new strategic cooperation with MoneyGram will add a partner with global remittance capabilities to our ecosystem and, while Ant Financial won’t have a direct ownership relationship with MoneyGram, we look forward to working closely with the MoneyGram team to make our platform even more accessible – particularly to unbanked and underserved communities globally – and create even better experiences for our customers.” – Doug Feagin, President of Ant Financial International</p>

<h2 id="pick-2-how-tencent-is-using-closed-loop-data-to-drive-better-insight-and-engagement">Pick #2. How Tencent Is Using Closed-Loop Data to Drive Better Insight and Engagement</h2>

<p>Because of Tencent’s family of businesses – including social, entertainment, news, literature, gaming, payment, sports, and others – they have a unique “connected” consumer data that goes beyond big data to create a closed-loop view of consumer data. This ecosystem of connected businesses enables Tencent to learn more completely about consumer beliefs, behavior, and preferences, enabling them to connect consumer behavior across channels – something that isn’t available in the US. This unique ability enables Tencent and marketers to draw better consumer-level insight and activate this with cross-channel programming. From a B2B perspective, Helen Luan, VP of Online Media Group at Tencent, indicates that they are able to leverage this unique insight to help brands develop a more complete “One View” of the consumer and as importantly, develop a more integrated, across platform relationship.</p>
