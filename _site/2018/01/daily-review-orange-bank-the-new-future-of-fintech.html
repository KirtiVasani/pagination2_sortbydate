<p><a href="https://gomedici.com/fintech-is-not-a-threat-to-banks-telcos-whatsapps-and-amazons-of-the-world-are/">FinTechs are no longer a threat to banks; the telcos, WhatsApps, and Amazons of the world are</a>. A French phone company is planning to take full advantage of the scale of its mobile customers and rightfully so – the owners of communication networks and tech corporations are the ones with the biggest advantage when it comes to delivering services at scale.</p>

<h2 id="pick-1-orange-bank-is-a-phone-company-the-future-of-fintech">Pick #1. Orange Bank: Is a Phone Company the Future of FinTech?</h2>

<p>The shift to smartphone banking should put telecom operators, handset makers, and the big technology groups in a strong position to go head to head with the traditional banks.</p>

<p>The more bits of the value chain that tech companies large or small steal from the banking groups, the more those banks will be reduced to the “dumb pipes” of the financial system.</p>

<p>But Orange has breached the barricades – with some early signs of success. If the client accumulation rate of its first 10 days of operation in November has been maintained, it will have amassed some 200,000 customers by now – double expectations – and be on its way to a target of 2 million, even before it has expanded its product range from the basics. Consumer loans and insurance are due to be added to payments and savings this year. Mortgages will follow at a later stage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Orange Bank has what it takes to disrupt in our view, including a strong brand and already 28 million mobile customers,” UBS analysts wrote in a note to clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our obsession with smartphones has helped Orange to number 62 in the latest Brandz ranking – far behind Apple or Facebook, but there is no French bank in the top 100.</p>
