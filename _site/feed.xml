The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in cooperation with McAfee reports that one major internet service provider (ISP) sees 80 billion malicious scans a day, the result of automated efforts by cybercriminals to identify vulnerable targets. Many researchers track the quantity of new malware released, with estimates ranging from 300,000 to a million viruses and other malicious software products created every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent study published by two organizations estimated that the economic cost of cybercrime to the world came close to $600 billion now, or 0.8% of global GDP. The reasons for this growth are listed to be the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quick adoption of new technologies by cybercriminals;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The increased number of new users online (these tend to be from low-income countries with weak cybersecurity);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The increased ease of committing cybercrime with the growth of Cybercrime-as-a-Service;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An expanding number of cybercrime “centers” that now include Brazil, India, North Korea, and Vietnam;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A growing financial sophistication among top-tier cybercriminals that, among other things, makes monetization easier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pick-1-economic-impact-of-cybercrime--no-slowing-down&quot;&gt;Pick #1. Economic Impact of Cybercrime – No Slowing Down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cybercrime costs the world close to $600 billion – a $150 billion increase since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banks remain the number one target of criminals, despite spending three times as much on cybersecurity than other industries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The loss of intellectual property (IP) and company-sensitive information accounts for at least a quarter of the cost of cybercrime and contributes annual losses of between $10 and $12 billion for the US and potentially $50 billion to $60 billion globally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ransomware is the fastest-growing type of cybercrime, aided by cybercrime-as-a-service, which is also flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identity theft is the most expensive form of property crime the in the US, costing $10 billion more than the losses attributed to all other property crime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies are enabling cybercrime by allowing criminals to hide their identity while paying for services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The digital world has transformed almost every aspect of our lives, including risk and crime, so that crime is more efficient, less risky, more profitable, and has never been easier to execute,” said Steve Grobman, Chief Technology Officer for McAfee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Consider the use of ransomware, where criminals can outsource much of their work to skilled contractors. Ransomware-as-a-service cloud providers efficiently scale attacks to target millions of systems, and attacks are automated to require minimal human involvement. Add to these factors cryptocurrencies that ease rapid monetization while minimizing the risk of arrest, and you must sadly conclude that the 600-billion-dollar cybercrime figure reflects the extent to which our technological accomplishments have transformed the criminal economy as dramatically as they have every other portion of our economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, real adoption is coming. There is an infrastructure inversion on the horizon. We have suffered several infrastructure inversions in the past century. They are never obvious, only in hindsight. Cars were made fun of when they got stuck in mud roads dominated by horses. Once the infrastructure switched and roads improved, horses could still walk on them, but cars got way faster. For years, telecommunication companies refused to switch from analog to digital to communicate more data. Once they did, it was trivial to run voice over their new infrastructure, but the other way around was almost impossible. I think the same is true with Bitcoin: traditional banking that takes days and charges high fees can be easily implemented on Bitcoin, but the opposite is not true.” – Ramon Recuero, a Hacker at YC.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Mobile is a global platform that today supports two-thirds of the world’s population, delivering the connectivity and infrastructure that is powering new digital economies and addressing socioeconomic challenges,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/number-of-global-mobile-subscribers-to-surpass-five-billion-this-year/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mats Granryd, Director General of the GSMA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only two types of conglomerates controlling access to the most important platform for businesses – smartphone manufacturers and mobile network operators. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://gomedici.com/can-smartphone-manufacturers-win-the-mobile-payments-race/&quot;&gt;smartphone manufacturers are best positioned to control the gateway into one’s digital (and with that, physical) life&lt;/a&gt;, telecom operators are in a power of connectivity and distribution. The 2017 global edition of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/&quot;&gt;GSMA’s Mobile Economy report&lt;/a&gt; reveals that there will be 5.7 billion mobile subscribers by the end of this decade. By that point, the organization notes, almost three-quarters of the world’s population will be subscribed to a mobile service. Subscriber growth over this period will be driven primarily by large Asia markets such as India, which alone is forecast to add 310 million new unique subscribers by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being largely overlooked as the gatekeepers to scale in global consumer markets, mobile operators have significant advantages to offer to the FinTech community. Startups in the financial sector and mobile operators may just be the perfect allies due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsma.com/identity/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Mobile-Operators-and-Fintech.pdf&quot;&gt;complimentary hallmarks&lt;/a&gt;: while FinTech startups bring rapid innovation and flexibility, operators provide a powerful access to market with their marketing and distribution capabilities, as well as some specific enablers, available at scale that facilitate their partners deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GSMA 2017 study emphasizes at least two main groups of reasons why telecom companies and FinTech startups may be just the perfect allies. Operators provide powerful marketing and distribution channels which can include promotion and download through the operator’s online channels or apps, preload partner application on handsets distributed by the operator, co-branding, first level of customer support, and other specific promotion activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, GSMA notes that that carrier billing dramatically improves the conversion rate of digital contents purchase – simply because the customer can pay seamlessly without the hassle of entering payment credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telecom companies, holding a deep depository of subscriber data and trust built through decades, can come in handy in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gomedici.com/how-technology-impacts-the-three-most-important-moments-in-retail/&quot;&gt;the most important moments in customer journey&lt;/a&gt; that can make or break a startup service – sign up, sign in, checkout, and KYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most recent examples of a forward-thinking tech company leveraging the advantages of a telecom provider for the purposes of cybersecurity and fraud prevention is the&lt;a href=&quot;https://gomedici.com/daily-review-future-of-authentication-mobile-instant-and-already-here/&quot;&gt; Payfone &amp;amp; O2 partnership&lt;/a&gt;. Payfone, a leading digital identity authentication company, and UK mobile network operator O2 have signed a partnership contract to protect mobile users against cyber-hacks, account takeover attacks, SIM swap attacks, and other forms of digital fraud. The partnership leverages&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payfone.com/products/instant-authentication-for-mobile/&quot;&gt; Payfone’s Instant Authentication for Mobile solution&lt;/a&gt;, which is already being used by 6 of the top 10 banks in the United States, allowing UK enterprises to be able to extend fast, secure, and transparent authentication to their customers. The service uses real-time authentication via O2 that works behind-the-scenes with no on-device software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Telecoms today have unique access to ever-growing digital and social networking information revealing customer demographics, psychographics, and economic behaviors. Monetizing this underutilized asset could generate billions of dollars in revenue and render operators more competitive,” Ina Goldberg, Head of Data Science, and Kevin Mellyn, Strategic Advisor, SteppeChange, &lt;a href=&quot;http://steppechange.com/new-business-models/&quot;&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the center of all these opportunities is data. With large subscriber bases, telecom companies generate rich consumer behavior data on a daily basis, offering a detailed look into one’s personal digital universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User authentication is likely to be one of the fastest deals for startup-MNO partnership use cases, along with identity verification and service use authorization. In fact, an initiative by GSMA called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsma.com/identity/mobile-connect&quot;&gt;Mobile Connect&lt;/a&gt; covers even a wider range of advantages telecom operators can offer to vendors. Mobile Connect is claimed to be a secure universal login solution that matches users to their mobile phone, allowing them to log-in to websites and applications without passwords and usernames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, one of the vendors of Mobile Connect is an augmented identity company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idemia.com/&quot;&gt;IDEMIA&lt;/a&gt;, which recently in collaboration with the Alabama Department of Revenue &lt;a href=&quot;https://gomedici.com/daily-review-how-to-assess-cryptocurrencys-fundamental-value/&quot;&gt;announced the full-scale deployment of the electronic ID app&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alabamaeid.com/&quot;&gt;Alabama eID&lt;/a&gt;) to protect residents against state income tax refund theft. Gemalto, Huawei, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noknok.com/&quot;&gt;Nok Nok Labs&lt;/a&gt; are also among the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsma.com/identity/mobile-connect-vendors&quot;&gt;Mobile Connect vendors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business models of collaborative development between tech startups and telecom companies vary, but, as GSMA notes, the principle is always that the operator brings exposure to market and, in return, can provide their customers with enhanced access to differentiating services. Here are some of the models the organization emphasizes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The operator is a pure distributor (and possibly an enabler as well). The service provider pays the operator, typically through revenue share. In practice, the operator can collect the money for the service provider, e.g. via carrier billing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Co-branding. The operator usually sells the service and pays the service provider accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operator service. The service provider is an enabler and is paid like a supplier, usually per customer or per event.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the operational perspective, APIs are the bridge between telecom companies and the startup world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In the software supporting mobile networks, operator APIs make it possible for third parties to use certain mobile network functions within their applications. As this means giving access to their core assets, mobile operators must weigh security and strategic considerations before opening their APIs. But after several years of learnings from API programs launched by pioneering operators like Telefonica (BlueVia program), Deutsche Telekom (Developer Garden), AT&amp;amp;T (Developer Program) and the GSMA (One API), most large mobile operators in emerging markets have begun to open their APIs too, such as Orange (Middle East and Africa), Axiata (in Sri Lanka with Dialog), and Globe (Philippines).” – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GSMA_Mobile-operators-start-ups-in-emerging-markets.pdf&quot;&gt;APIs: A bridge between mobile operators and startups in emerging markets&lt;/a&gt;, GSMA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/image_preview%20(1).png&quot; alt=&quot;image_preview (1).png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In emerging markets, where mobile operators are the main enablers of the digital economy, operator APIs are a powerful channel for unlocking creativity and giving the startup ecosystem a boost. Every time an operator opens a new set of APIs, it creates a powerful cycle of innovation as startups can combine several APIs to create new services. For example, a startup can offer SMS-based localized content to its users depending on their city or area, and then charge them by deducting the amount from their mobile airtime. Such a service would leverage three operator APIs simultaneously: SMS, location, and direct operator billing. Startups and developers across emerging markets are already building mobile services using operator APIs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, mobile operators are also the main actors of inclusive digital transformation. In emerging economies, mobile penetration is found to be considerably higher than banking penetration, which provides telecom companies with an edge for marketing financial products to their clients through greater reach, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsma.com/identity/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Mobile-Operators-and-Fintech.pdf&quot;&gt;GSMA&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the relation between banking and telecommunication will become increasingly dynamic and complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Authentication &amp; Security&quot;, &quot;Financial Inclusion&quot;]" /><category term="mobile network" /><category term="MNO" /><category term="startups" /><category term="authentication" /><category term="identity management" /><category term="digital identity" /><summary type="html">“Mobile is a global platform that today supports two-thirds of the world’s population, delivering the connectivity and infrastructure that is powering new digital economies and addressing socioeconomic challenges,” said Mats Granryd, Director General of the GSMA.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Daily Review: Biometrics – The Foundation of Inclusive Digital Transformation</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/02/daily-review-biometrics-foundation-of-inclusive-digital-transformation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Daily Review: Biometrics – The Foundation of Inclusive Digital Transformation" /><published>2018-02-21T12:14:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-02-21T12:14:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/02/daily-review-biometrics-foundation-of-inclusive-digital-transformation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/02/daily-review-biometrics-foundation-of-inclusive-digital-transformation.html">&lt;p&gt;With approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://gomedici.com/1-5-billion-people-around-the-world-cannot-prove-their-identity/&quot;&gt;1.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; people around the world unable to prove their identity, inclusion remains one of the most severe economic and social issues across nations. Biometric technology is often seen as one of the most intuitive and potentially successful ways to shed light on “invisible” populations, all while making a place for the previously excluded in the new digital economy.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, some estimates suggest that by 2021, the market will reach a value of&lt;a href=&quot;http://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-market-shift-304256/&quot;&gt; $30 billion&lt;/a&gt; with its primary revenues shifting from the government sector to banking and consumer electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fingerprint sensors, in particular, are expected to be a major force with shipments forecast to approach&lt;a href=&quot;http://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-market-shift-304256/&quot;&gt; 2 billion&lt;/a&gt; by 2021, reflecting an overall growth rate of 44%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As biometric technology is believed to be the most convenient method of identification/authentication, the technology is rapidly gaining popularity in the financial services industry and beyond. Certain regions are already exploring the inclusive effect of biometric identification, while other markets are more focused on the other hallmark of the technology – convenience in the digital era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pick-1-how-biometrics-is-giving-identities-to-invisible-citizens&quot;&gt;Pick #1. How Biometrics Is Giving Identities to ‘Invisible Citizens’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simprints.com/&quot;&gt;Simprints&lt;/a&gt; makes portable fingerprint readers for charities around the world. It’s working with charities in Kenya to provide digital healthcare records for people in poorer communities, who don’t have any official documents. For each person who has their fingerprint scanned, an algorithm creates a unique ID, which can be linked to their health records. Health workers can access the information and update health records using an app on a cell phone or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The biometric technology is enabling a lot of charities and organizations to leapfrog a computer-based system and go straight from a paper-based system to a mobile system.” – Alexandra Grigore, Co-founder, Simprints&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Mwaura, Head of Technology at the Kenyan community health charity &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cohesu.com/&quot;&gt;COHESU&lt;/a&gt;, is working with a team of doctors and volunteers, using Simprints’ technology to scan prints and create one of the country’s first biometric identification databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Biometrics as a technology has completely changed our way of thinking,” Mwaura said to CNN. He says Simprints is giving citizens without identities hope and access to a better-synced healthcare system. “Without it, they’d probably stay at home and accept their fate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once someone is successfully enrolled they can easily visit a doctor – who can then access their entire medical history digitally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM Security’s “Future of Identity” Study surveyed nearly 4,000 adults around the globe. Here are some of the top findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security is beginning to outweigh convenience. People ranked security as the highest priority, over convenience and privacy, for logging in to the majority of applications, particularly when it comes to money-related apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biometric technology is becoming mainstream. About 67% of respondents are comfortable using biometric authentication today, while 87% say they’ll be comfortable with these technologies in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Millennials are moving beyond passwords. While 75% of millennials (respondents between the ages of 20 and 36) are comfortable using biometrics today, less than half are using complex passwords and 41% reuse passwords to access numerous accounts. Older generations showed more care with password creation but were less inclined to adopt biometrics and multi-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Innovative use of data – sources and analytical capabilities – bring up the question of ownership and privacy, the changing underlying technology, the entrance of new types of players with unconventional business models, and introductions of new products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and adoption of advanced data analytics capabilities made it possible to explore new revenue avenues. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torontocentre.org/&quot;&gt;Toronto Centre&lt;/a&gt; characterizes the data-intensive era through three V’s: high velocity, large variety, and big volumes of data. With that, it also brings raising concerns for data protection and privacy, bank secrecy, cybersecurity, and data management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For instance, how to enforce customer consent requirements when any type of data can be used, even if its original collection had nothing to do with financial services (e.g., “likes” on Facebook, Google maps locations), or when financial transactions are seamless and automatized in the IoT? Are regulations on cross-border data flows adequate for the IoT and cloud computing? What constitutes “personal” data in this context, and who should own it: customers or the entities collecting the data?” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://res.torontocentre.org/guidedocs/FinTech%20RegTech%20and%20SupTech%20-%20What%20They%20Mean%20for%20Financial%20Supervision.pdf&quot;&gt;FinTech, RegTech, and SupTech: What They Mean for Financial Supervision&lt;/a&gt;, Toronto Centre&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With technology changing the financial services industry, regulatory authorities are forced to find new ways to understand and ensure positive implications and long-term sustainability of those changes. RegTech came as a solution to bring down &lt;a href=&quot;https://gomedici.com/cost-of-bank-misconduct/&quot;&gt;the cost of misconduct&lt;/a&gt; and find a tech solution to a highly complex and expensive matter of compliance. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iif.com/publication/research-note/regtech-financial-services-solutions-compliance-and-reporting&quot;&gt;Defined&lt;/a&gt; by IIF as the use of new technologies to solve regulatory and compliance requirements more effectively and efficiently, RegTech has been one of the hottest investment and entrepreneurship areas, but it also has been a starting point for another area of development – supervisory technology, or SupTech – which offers an opportunity to supervisory agencies much like RegTech brings efficiency to industry regulators and reporting institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Toronto Centre, as in RegTech, SupTech solutions are automating and streamlining administrative and operational procedures, digitizing data and working tools, and improving data analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Some financial authorities are also exploring opportunities to automate the regulatory process. Increasingly, innovations bet on an emerging revamping of financial supervision itself, a shift away from current approaches based on past data, lengthy onsite inspections and often delayed supervisory action, towards a proactive, forward-looking supervision that relies on better data collection and sophisticated data analytics, and greater storage and mobility capacity such as by using cloud computing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main &lt;a href=&quot;http://res.torontocentre.org/guidedocs/FinTech%20RegTech%20and%20SupTech%20-%20What%20They%20Mean%20for%20Financial%20Supervision.pdf&quot;&gt;promises of SupTech&lt;/a&gt; is seen in shifting away from templates and manual procedures to support data input and data pull approaches, data accessibility, reporting utilities, making sense of unstructured data, data quality management, and, finally, regulatory submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/leveraging-suptech-financial-inclusion-rwanda&quot;&gt;The World Bank describes an interesting example of how SupTech is being embraced by a whole nation – Rwanda.&lt;/a&gt; According to the World Bank, Rwanda has an ambitious financial inclusion agenda and also epitomizes a data-driven culture; as a result, there is an almost insatiable demand for accurate, high-frequency data to monitor financial inclusion progress. And, since the establishment of over 400 Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) in 2009 and the entry of mobile network operators into the financial services space beginning in 2010, the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has had to significantly expand the scope of its supervisory mandate to cover new FSPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNR partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunoida.com/&quot;&gt;Sunoida Solutions&lt;/a&gt; to develop an electronic &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunoida.com/services/data-warehouse&quot;&gt;data warehouse&lt;/a&gt; (EDW) system to automate and streamline the reporting processes that inform and facilitate supervision. The EDW system went live in May 2016. As of June 2016, the system covered eight banks, three microfinance institutions, two money transfer operators, and one MNO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The EDW system is meant to generate operational efficiencies at BNR and improve the quality, frequency, and scope of reported data. For banks and other FSPs with sophisticated information systems, the EDW allows BNR to automatically “pull” data from their systems. This approach reduces the need for compliance officers at these institutions to manually construct and send reports, as well as the errors and inconsistencies often associated with this process. BNR pulls some types of data daily (e.g. related to transactions), greatly improving the degree to which BNR supervisors can monitor the market in real time.” – The World Bank&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Singapore is on the SupTech bandwagon with its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Speeches-and-Monetary-Policy-Statements/Speeches/2017/Singapore-FinTech-Journey-2.aspx&quot;&gt;ambition to strengthen supervision and reduce compliance costs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Speeches-and-Monetary-Policy-Statements/Speeches/2017/Singapore-FinTech-Journey-2.aspx&quot;&gt;Singapore FinTech Journey 2.0&lt;/a&gt; describes MAS embarking on its own FinTech journey to make supervision more effective and the compliance burden it imposes less painful. An example described by Ravi Menon, Managing Director of MAS, is the use of SupTech for detecting trade syndicates in the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most difficult things to detect in the market is collusive behavior and price manipulation. MAS has put a data analytics and pattern recognition system in place to study trading behavior and detect accounts that may be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;acting in concert to manipulate share prices, or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;engaging in circular trading to create a false impression of market interest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example from the remarks is MAS working on a data analytics system to scour through the 3,000 suspicious transaction reports, or STRs, that financial institutions file each month on money laundering or terrorist financing risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major source of pain for financial institutions is regulators requesting for the same data more than once under different data collection exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We will fix this. By taking a more cohesive approach to data, MAS will aim to achieve zero duplication in our data requests to financial institutions. If we ask for the same data twice, the institution will be allowed to gently turn us down! We will work with the industry on making this a reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Today, financial institutions’ data submissions to MAS often involve manual processes to extract the information from their databases and fill up the MAS-provided form or template. And over at MAS, processing that data is also done manually. We will make this more painless. We have set a goal: all data requests from MAS will eventually be in machine-readable templates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The requested data will flow seamlessly from financial institutions’ databases to our forms and ultimately to the supervisory dashboards of MAS officers. No more “cut-and-paste.” We will work with the industry on an implementation plan and a reasonable timeline.” – Ravi Menon, Managing Director, MAS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential uses of SupTech by central banks and prudential authorities are yet to be fully discovered, developed, and adopted. Nonetheless, financial institutions are already exploring the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P011117.pdf&quot;&gt;convergence of advanced technologies (AI, deep learning, NLP, etc.) and supervisory solutions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Use of machine learning combined with NLP can be used to identify patterns for further attention from supervisors in large and complex data. Machine learning can also be used with NLP to link trading databases to other information on market participants. This could include, for example, the ability to integrate and compare trading activity information with behavioral data like communications and to compare normal trading scenarios with those that may have substantial deviations, triggering the need for further analysis.” – &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P011117.pdf&quot;&gt;Artificial intelligence and machine learning in financial services: Market developments and financial stability implications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Financial Stability Board&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the paper called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d431.pdf&quot;&gt;Sound Practices: Implications of FinTech developments for banks and bank supervisors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by the Bank for International Settlements, the organization emphasizes that the aim of these initiatives is to help companies navigate the supervisory regulations applicable to fully operational financial service institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“While the level of support offered by each initiative varies, they all seek to provide regulatory guidance to innovative startups and incumbent firms. From the authorities’ perspective, these interactions with innovative firms add value by deepening the supervisory understanding of the risks and benefits emerging from the new technologies, products, and services, as also noted by the FSB. A proactive approach to innovation also has the benefit of helping regulatory agencies identify and explore the use of new technologies for internal supervisory purposes (SupTech).” – BIS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sound Practices: Implications of FinTech developments for banks and bank supervisors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the risks associated with FinTech vary significantly across the different scenarios, the identified opportunities will depend less on particular scenarios and more on the technologies that will allow them to be realized. Some important opportunities to consider include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial inclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital finance has improved access to financial services by underserved groups. Technology can reach remote locations. Only 6 out of 10 adults have a bank account, but there are more mobile devices than there are people in the world. The promise of digital finance to reach scale, reduce costs and, if coupled with the appropriate financial capability, broaden access is unprecedented. Financial services could be provided to more people with greater speed, accountability, and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better and more tailored banking services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks are already regulated and know how to bring products to a regulated market. FinTech companies could help the banking industry improve their traditional offerings in many ways. Banks may, for example, provide white-label robo-advisors to help customers navigate the investment world and create a better and tailored customer experience. Partnerships with FinTech companies could also increase the efficiency of incumbent businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower transaction costs and faster banking services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovations from FinTech players may speed up transfers and payments and cut their costs. For instance, in the area of cross-border transfers, FinTech companies can provide faster banking services at lower costs in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved and more efficient banking processes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation may allow the conduct of operations in a safer environment thanks to the use of cryptographic or biometric technologies and more interoperable systems decreasing the chances of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential positive impact on financial stability due to increased competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entry of new players competing with incumbent banks could eventually fragment the banking services market and reduce the systemic risk associated with players of systemic size, as also analyzed by the FSB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RegTech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FinTech could be used to improve compliance processes at financial institutions. Regulation is increasing globally but the effective development and application of “RegTech” (see Box 5 below) could create opportunities to, for example, automate regulatory reporting and compliance requirements as well as facilitate more cross-sectoral and cross-jurisdictional cooperation for improved compliance (e.g. AML/CFT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiongwen Rui, Vice President and Head of Security &amp;amp; Risk Management at Ant Financial, said that Ant Financial’s e-payment service, Alipay, has a fraud-loss rate of less than 0.01 basis points. Ant Financial uses a dynamic QR code which does not contain any credit card information, along with a payment password and a fingerprint verification system, so that even if one’s smartphone is stolen, the e-wallet uploaded there would be useless.&lt;/p&gt;

The global financial crisis exposed many loopholes in the existing regulatory risk assessment framework. However, since then, regulators have sprung into action and are constantly looking for ways to enhance their supervision of the industry, ensuring that a repeat of the 2008 crisis does not happen. As a result, several enhancements to the existing regulations (Basel II, MiFID II, Solvency II, PSD II) as well as newer regulations (GDPR, Dodd-Frank) have come into play. With these regulations, financial watchdogs have begun to fix the challenges in the financial regulatory framework, but this has, in turn, resulted in a significant cost burden on banks and FIs who spent close to $100 billion on compliance in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/19thFeb_MondayresearchChart_for%20site2-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;19thFeb_MondayresearchChart_for site2-01.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every regulatory activity, there are hundreds and thousands of rule changes, which financial institutions need to be constantly aware of – any small mishap can cost them billions of dollars. However, the task is not as easy as it may sound – regulatory documents are thousands of pages long. It is challenging for banks and FIs, especially for the smaller ones who don’t have as many resources, to go through each and every one of them in a short span of time, identify the relevant change needs, and apply those changes in their processes to stay compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there have been strong mandates on how data needs to be managed. This is a compelling case for technology-driven innovation, where the use of ML and NLP can help banks scan these documents and extract relevant information which caters to their business, thus enabling them to take necessary steps to stay compliant. This is where RegTech comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RegTech, defined as the use of new technologies to solve regulatory and compliance requirements more effectively and efficiently, has established a solid foundation within the FinTech ecosystem by coming up with solutions that targeted complex new regulations, litigation, and regulatory remediation areas faced by banks, and the overall reduction of costs of compliance. With the use of agile, cloud-based technologies, RegTech provides FIs help with their compliance needs. With the technology spend by banks and FIs expected to reach $80 billion by 2020, there is a huge opportunity for RegTech to scale and make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a surge in the number of RegTech startups that provide a range of services, such as regulatory reporting solutions, data governance tools, transaction fraud monitoring, e-KYC, risk management, etc. There are some large technology providers who also offer comprehensive GRC solutions. Thus, banks and FIs have a plethora of choices available for transforming their governance, risk, and compliance functions. Moreover, the scope of RegTech spans over regulators as well. There are companies (e.g. Vizor) who offer new-age technology solutions to regulators, enabling them to enhance their supervisory functions and monitoring risk with a comprehensive view of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, RegTech is indeed the need of the hour in the ever-dynamic financial services industry, and it is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;RegTech&quot;]" /><category term="regtech" /><category term="compliance" /><category term="banking" /><category term="KYC" /><category term="AML" /><summary type="html">Regulations have always been a cumbersome affair for the banking and financial services industry.

&lt;p&gt;Today, smartphones that use machine learning depend on cloud servers which limit how information is processed. Having a built-in artificial intelligence processing unit, however, could change that and increase a device’s computing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British chip design firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arm.com/&quot;&gt;ARM&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind virtually every chip in today’s smartphones, now wants to put the power of AI into every mobile device. Currently, devices that run AI algorithms depend on servers in the cloud. It’s a rather limited setup, with online connectivity affecting how information is sent back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

This fast-growing segment is also stressed about their personal finances. According to the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wellsfargofunds.com/ip/campaign/millennials.html?WT.mc_id=34768_surveyfindings_Pressrelease&quot;&gt;Wells Fargo Millennial Study&lt;/a&gt;, 69% of respondents say they want to get over their “anxiety” about money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As financial institutions look for creative ways to help millennials better manage their finances, they can take inspiration from adjacent digital markets like e-commerce and social media applications where data-driven personalization is making customer experiences more rewarding while at the same time creating new revenue generation opportunities for companies. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/01/pf/fintech-share/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN Money&lt;/a&gt;, millennials want to share and compare everything. Whether it’s using the “customers also bought” section popping up beneath purchases, or crowd-sourcing on social feeds, or deciding what to wear, what to eat, and where to travel; the gold standard for guidance is the advice of a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/30425383/adroit-millennials-brand-loyalty-study-final-03-12-14&quot;&gt;Adriot Digital’s Millenials: The New Age of Brand Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; report also supports this notion, with a majority of respondents stating that a recommendation from someone they know, or someone like them, is influential to their decision to buy a brand, second only in influence to price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can financial institutions leverage this “peer comparison” mentality to deliver more meaningful digital banking solutions and services to their customers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to quantify the definitions of “peer” and “shopping trends” so that they match the definitions that customers have. Grounding these definitions through a synergistic combination of big data, machine learning, and domain expertise is a great start. Banks have a treasure trove of transaction and account level data. As the data flows through banks’ multitude of data marts, they can normalize and cleanse the data to generate a “single source of truth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to enrich and analyze the data using machine learning and domain expertise to derive meaningful insights and enable peer benchmarking. For example, analyzing user-associated financial data over a period of time is an organic way of finding out how certain financial behaviors impact overall financial wellness. These aggregated data insights combined with financial indicators like debt-to-income ratios help to identify peers or “people-like-you” which are far more accurate than the peer groups identified using simple demographics of age and location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peer benchmarking allows financial institutions to deliver more meaningful insights and just-in-time recommendations to customers and in turn, empower them to learn from the best practices of peer groups to create financial wellness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improving-the-digital-banking-experience-through-peer-benchmarking&quot;&gt;Improving the Digital Banking Experience Through Peer Benchmarking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s digital banking population, especially millennials, want more from their online banking experience. They want forward-thinking services that allow them to seamlessly manage their financial lives. According to the 2017 Aite report on Digital Banking Customer Engagement: Adoption, Usage, and Satisfaction, in addition to spend management, millennials are increasingly demanding digital banking solutions to help educate and guide them in their journey to financial wellness – this includes financial coaching and education, peer comparison, and guidance on financial decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, there is a tremendous need for financial institutions to leverage data analytics to identify financial-behavior driven customer peer groups, unearth best practices and common pitfalls to avoid, and provide tools that guide customers in executing decisions that are in line with their financial goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;peer-comparisons-grounded-in-big-data-systematic-machine-learning--deep-domain-expertise&quot;&gt;Peer Comparisons Grounded in Big Data, Systematic Machine Learning &amp;amp; Deep Domain Expertise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where should financial institutions start? It is all about harnessing and leveraging the full strength of massive data sets – i.e., Big Data – by first making the data “machine learning-ready” through cleansing and normalization of data so that machine learning techniques can consume it optimally to generate actionable insights. This creates value for customers, particularly millennials, and the next generation of customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, financial institutions can assemble these insights in a seamless, stable, and sustainable way that is capable of delivering predictive and prescriptive insights to customers relative to their peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key components to creating this functionality include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-big-data-massive-data-set&quot;&gt;1. Big Data: Massive Data Set&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a successful predictive and prescriptive digital banking model requires an enormous amount of data across a variety of use cases to deliver the level of insights required. The massive scale of data enables companies to perform granular customer segmentation, compare financial behaviors among peer groups, and optimize services to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Amazon, for example. With over 300 million users, Amazon represented 43.5% of US retail e-commerce sales in 2017. Amazon is gathering the types of questions people ask about their finances and the frequency with which they ask them to proactively enhance offerings and the type of digital interactions with users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial institutions can also implement similar segmentation approaches and integrate with devices like Amazon Echo to answer a multitude of financial questions that are personalized to each user, as well as learn from each interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waze.com&quot;&gt;Waze&lt;/a&gt;, the largest community-based traffic and navigation app in the world with over 65 million active users in over 135 countries. By allowing drivers to join other drivers in their area and sharing real-time traffic and road information, Waze aims to save people time and gas money on their daily commute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Waze, financial institutions can utilize the massive amounts of data from customers to offer peer benchmarking features, such as provide guidance on how to reach their financial goals – while learning from the mistake of others and tracking their journey towards success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making it all work together requires a big data plan and thoughtful big data architecture that not only examines current data streams and repositories from crowd-sourced data but also accounts for specific business objectives and longer-term customer and market trends. Just as important, the data needs to be cleansed and normalized so that it is consumption-ready for machine learning techniques and made available to blend seamlessly with the overall customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-artificial-intelligence-ai--machine-learning&quot;&gt;2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp;amp; Machine Learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While simple data visualization techniques may yield useful insights, it is through new and advanced AI-driven tools, like deep learning, that we are better able to identify patterns in massive amounts of structured and unstructured data sets. AI agents that not only gather and analyze data, but then learn from that data analysis to adjust their predictions for better performance results, or to predict future customer behaviors, are key. We are in the midst of an exponential growth phase of machine learning and AI domains where these techniques are maturing and becoming increasingly reliable at a very rapid pace, therefore enabling data-driven insights based on peer comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take tech giant Google, for example, where chief executive Sundar Pichai had declared the company an “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/googles-jeff-dean-were-using-ai-to-build-machine-learning-systems/news-story/c0120711ad2368cc8d9938f7575a78ba&quot;&gt;AI-first company&lt;/a&gt;.” AI and machine learning are being used to improve seven of Google’s products, each with more than a billion users. Google is also piloting a program in 25 US cities where it makes predictions about parking at a journey’s destination in Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI can now read emails, and make predictions about the responses people might make, and offer them as alternatives. This type of solution would be beneficial for financial services customers as well, predicting how long it will take for customers to get from their current situation to their desired financial destination with recommendations along the way that are informed by peer comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robinhood.com/&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; is a free stock-trading app which has 3 million users and over $100 billion in transaction volume. By combining machine learning and user-research, Robinhood provides customers with unique tools featuring its proprietary data in a user-friendly interface. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.robinhood.com/news/2017/10/31/robinhood-now-on-web&quot;&gt;Robinhood for Web&lt;/a&gt; provides socially-driven tools for investors, featuring new information on each stock-detail page, including the number of people who own that stock and the average price they paid. There is a “People also bought” feature that shows which other stocks people have also bought. Financial institutions can integrate similar peer comparison features into their digital banking solution or partner with FinTech companies to provide innovative tools for customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the ability of machine learning-based applications to improve efficiency, augment the decision-making process, enable peer benchmarking, deliver predictive insights, and improve the customer experience, the technology can offer financial institutions immediate benefits for their business and their customers. While machine learning relies on algorithms that can learn from data without relying on rules-based programming, taking AI to the next level requires applying “rules of the road” and customizing the information based on its need and use case. That’s where domain expertise comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-deep-domain-expertise&quot;&gt;3. Deep Domain Expertise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When big data and AI-driven machine learning are combined with deep domain expertise, data science teams can create “smarter” platforms that convert outputs of these algorithms to automate day-to-day financial tasks and allow peer comparisons. This creates actionable recommendations for millennials and others to help them better manage their financial lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/banking-customer-insights&quot;&gt;IBM Watson Customer Insight for Banking&lt;/a&gt; uses advanced prebuilt industry-specific analytic models that combine predictive and cognitive capabilities. The AI-based solution enables dynamic behavioral segmentation to uncover actionable customer insights, allowing banks to create personalized sales offerings and marketing campaigns. Financial institutions can partner with technology providers that bring expertise from specific domains, as well as big data and machine learning, to deliver personalized banking solutions with peer comparison features for millennials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of a broad spectrum of big data and analytics tools available – including machine learning and deep learning, as well as predictive and prescriptive analytics based on data from peer benchmarking – AI is forging a new era in digital financial services that is changing the face of banking in a way that creates more compelling and engaging services &amp;amp; solutions for customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology is transforming the way millennials and others behave and this is quite evident in financial services. By combining the power of AI with the capacity to learn from large customer datasets and establish patterns and correlations in customer financial behaviors, financial institutions can deliver more personalized digital banking solutions to target segments with recommendations based on peer benchmarking. This leads to more engaged customers, and potentially higher revenue and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial institutions can either develop these technologies in-house and/or partner with a third-party provider that offers those capabilities. While many financial service providers may excel at one or two of the key components for peer comparisons, the companies that thrive amidst the competition will likely be those that can combine all three capabilities to deliver financial wellness solutions for millennials.&lt;/p&gt;

The Alabama Department of Revenue Deploys First State-Wide Identity Protection Program to Fight State Income Tax Refund Theft&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a successful 2017 pilot program, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idemia.com/&quot;&gt;IDEMIA&lt;/a&gt;, a company claiming to be a leader in Augmented Identity for a digital world, and the Alabama Department of Revenue have announced the full-scale deployment of the electronic ID app (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alabamaeid.com/&quot;&gt;Alabama eID&lt;/a&gt;) to protect residents against state income tax refund theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alabama eID app is available for download in the App Store and Google Play. Users complete a short registration process in which their identities are verified by scanning their physical driver’s license or state-issued ID and taking a selfie with their smartphone. This information is compared against the data and photo on record in the driver’s license database to verify that the person registering for the app is who they claim to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Alabama eID, there are no usernames or passwords to remember, and only the user can authorize the Department of Revenue to process his/her state income tax refund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using facial recognition technology, the Alabama eID verifies a person’s identity by matching his/her face against the picture used to make one’s driver’s license or state-issued ID.&lt;/p&gt;
