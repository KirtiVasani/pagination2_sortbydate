    <p align="center"><strong><em>Ex-Adyen North America President, Peter Caparso, joins Checkout.com to lead US growth</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Boston, October 3, 2017, 9:00 AM EST</em> –</strong> Leading international online payments company, <a href="https://www.checkout.com/">Checkout.com</a> has today announced its launch into the US market, with the opening of a Boston office. Spearheaded by payments industry veteran Peter Caparso, Checkout.com’s expansion into the North American region is in direct response to growing customer demand in the payments space for truly global service providers. Checkout.com works directly with customers to handle payments in any country through a single integration.</p>
<p>With 180 employees worldwide, Checkout.com runs on 100% proprietary payment rails. Checkout.com connects merchants seamlessly with all credit and debit cards, as well as major alternative payment methods. By removing all third-party intermediaries, Checkout.com eliminates the need for customers to use multiple service providers and consolidates the entire payments process from start to finish. Customers include Samsung, TransferWise, Hopper, Virgin, and Adidas, among many others.</p>
<p>Peter Caparso joins Checkout.com as President of North America. Caparso previously launched Adyen in the US, where he served as North America President for over six years. Prior to Adyen, Caparso also served as Executive Vice-President at Worldpay and US Country Manager at Bibit. Most recently, he was the Payments Advisor at Apax Partners, a leading global private equity firm. At Checkout.com, Caparso will lead the company’s US expansion, personnel development, and customer portfolio.</p>
<p><em>“There is an unmet need in the market for customer-service oriented payment services,” </em>says Caparso.<em> “As a privately owned, entrepreneurial company, agility is our strength. Checkout.com is able to anticipate and react to merchants’ needs quickly and efficiently. Whether in retail, travel, or digital goods and services, we are positioned to be the payment solution of choice for fast-growing companies seeking a flexible partner.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The US is the next great milestone in our global expansion,” </em>states Guillaume Pousaz, CEO &amp; Founder of Checkout.com.<em> “We operate in a competitive market and want to ensure that our products deliver the most value possible for our customers. We have a strong track-record of working with some of the most innovative brands in the world. Our international DNA, entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to providing tailored solutions make us a unique partner in a sector where commoditization tends to be the industry norm. We’re ready to take the next step into the US and are excited about the initial market response.”</em></p>
<p>As a principal member of VISA/Mastercard® and all other major credit card schemes and main alternative payment methods, Checkout.com offers a highly tailored payment solution in over 180 currencies, removing hidden costs and complex reconciliations, while focusing on delivering excellent customer service and increased authorization rates.</p>
