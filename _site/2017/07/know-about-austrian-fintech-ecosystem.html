    <h4>Europe and the FinTech Adventure: The Austrian Case</h4>
<p>As <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the FinTech industry</a> keeps <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/global-fintech-funding-36-bn-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing</a>, it is fundamental to know where to find the best conditions to start and effectively run a company. Although it may seem that online technologies have diminished the role of geolocation, <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">MEDICI</a>’s experience shows how important it is to have the best services available for our activities. </p>
<p><b>Austria</b> has been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/federicoguerrini/2016/07/08/austria-wants-to-attract-startups-with-a-204-million-program/#6a387ae43b5f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recognized</a> as one of <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/which-are-the-top-3-hottest-fintech-hubs-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most interesting international <b>startup</b> hotspots</a>. The startup community, and particularly FinTech startup community, is growing day by day, and finding a lively ecosystem. </p>
<p>One of the reasons for such development is that Austria’s environment perfectly fits startups’ needs. The past few months have seen the birth of many communities and <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/88-international-startup-accelerators-incubators-innovation-labs-nurturing-innovators-in-financial-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incubators</a>. New services are available online, providing any kind of information that could be useful for startups. Let’s take a closer look at some of the initiatives enabling entrepreneurs to launch and run a successful business in Austria:</p>
<p><strong>The Startup Program by the Austrian Federal Government</strong> </p>
