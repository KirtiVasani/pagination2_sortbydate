    <p>For the growing<a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> startup ecosystem</a>, success can be measured by more than just financial transactions – there has to be a good fit between<a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/83-fintech-vc-firms-to-consider-if-you-are-a-fintech-startup-raising-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> investors</a> and startups. In addition to capital, entrepreneurs require the correct set of expertise, connections, and support from their investors. An increasingly competitive market makes it difficult to find the right partner, fueling the need for a matchmaker between startups and investors. The<a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/innovation-programmes/singapore-fintech-festival-investor-summit-deal-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Investor Summit – “Deal Day”</a> is an initiative powered by EY and<a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> MEDICI</a>, FinTech’s global knowledge network for collaborative innovation, and will function as a matchmaking platform for startups and investors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27209" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/go-medici/uploads/2017/07/Dealday1.jpg" alt="Investor Summit – “Deal Day” Launches in Singapore: Experience Matchmaking Like Never Before" width="937" height="375" /></p>
<p><i>“EY is proud to power the Investor Summit – “Deal Day” and we will do our part to help FinTechs gain access to capital in order to scale and reach their full potential,”</i> Liew Nam Soon, EY Managing Partner for ASEAN Financial Services.</p>
<p>The summit will showcase investment-worthy global startups and disruptive technologies to local and global investors and facilitate FinTech funding deals. As part of the<a href="http://www.fintechfestival.sg/investor-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF) 2017</a>, the Deal Day will bring together the best innovative startups on November 17, 2017, giving investors an opportunity to be part of the FinTech ecosystem. The Deal Day will allow investors to get matched with potential startups with no investment commitment. The matchmaking will ensure the best fit by taking personalized preferences into consideration.</p>
<p>The plethora of benefits offered to participants is strengthened by the fact that the summit will take place in Singapore, which has been continuously recognized among<a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/which-are-the-top-3-hottest-fintech-hubs-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the hottest FinTech hubs around the world</a>. The collective efforts of<a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/singapores-fintech-industry-global-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the vibrant FinTech ecosystem in Singapore</a>, financial watchdogs, VCs and other stakeholders, ensured<a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/can-singapore-become-the-ultimate-fintech-hub-of-the-apac-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the leading position of Asian financial center</a>:</p>
