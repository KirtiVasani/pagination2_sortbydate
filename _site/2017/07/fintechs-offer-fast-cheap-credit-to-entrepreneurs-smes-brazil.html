    <p>Today, in Brazil, we have over 30 FinTech startups offering credit products, according to 2017’s <a href="http://fintechlab.com.br/index.php/category/radar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FinTechLab Radar</a> survey. FinTech startups in this segment are attractive because they have lower interest rates. A survey by <a href="https://www.sebrae.com.br/sites/PortalSebrae" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebrae</a> and the Central Bank indicates that the average interest charged by banks for micro-entrepreneurs is <a href="http://pme.estadao.com.br/noticias/pme,sem-garantias-pequeno-empresario-nem-recorre-ao-banco-para-pegar-credito,20000000279,0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4.5% per month</a>, while FinTech startups similar to <a href="https://www.nexoos.com.py/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexoos</a> offer rates ranging from 1.6% to 2.25% per month.</p>
<p><i>"In general, the client's experience with FinTechs technology is more efficient and less bureaucratic than the banks themselves,"</i> noted Ricardo Assaf, President of ABSCM (Brazilian Association of Microcredit Societies). An interesting example to mention here would be <a href="https://rapidoo.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapidoo</a>, which is able to make the credit release in up to 30 minutes for businesses that bill up to R $200K. </p>
<p>It is important to understand, though, that while the mentioned startups are not financial institutions themselves, they are linked to financial institutions authorized by the Central Bank. <i>"The financial environment is highly regulated. You cannot begin [a FinTech] and then regularize [it]. It either becomes a financial institution or aligns in partnership with one,"</i> explained Ricardo Assaf. Therefore, there are FinTech startups that mediate between banks and individual investors, as well as those that are associated with some banks.</p>
<p>Examples of FinTech startups that assist in going through the bureaucratic process of obtaining credit from a financial institution include <a href="http://www.captamoney.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capta Money</a> and <a href="http://www.avante.com.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avante</a>. Lending startups bridge the gap between companies and investors through peer-to-peer lending, according to FinTech data in the table below.</p>

<p>Kavod Digital wants to reach more than 35K investors and 2K companies in the next five years, according to its CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabioneufeld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fábio Neufeld</a>. The company starts its operating in July. <i>"We have an open investment round of R $500K, and we already have an angel investor who will contribute 60% of the value,"</i> said Neufeld.</p>
