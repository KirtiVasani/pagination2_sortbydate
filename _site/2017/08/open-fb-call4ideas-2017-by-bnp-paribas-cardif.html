    <p>One of the top 10 insurance companies in Italy – <a href="http://www.bnpparibascardif.it/">BNP Paribas Cardif</a> – is building tomorrow’s insurance on this new paradigm: innovate to prevent, assist and protect. At its fourth edition of <a href="http://www.bnpparibas.it/en/2017/07/24/open-fb-call4ideas-2017-by-bnp-paribas-cardif-when-innovation-helps-to-prevent-and-protect/">Open-F@b Call4Ideas</a>, the international contest for startups will award the three most innovative ideas on <b><i>Preventive Insurance</i></b>. </p>
<div align="center"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYwW989sIaI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>As explained by <a href="http://www.bnpparibascardif.it/">BNP Paribas Cardif</a> in the <a href="http://www.bnpparibas.it/en/2017/07/24/open-fb-call4ideas-2017-by-bnp-paribas-cardif-when-innovation-helps-to-prevent-and-protect/">official press release</a>, in its application, Preventive Insurance will have a growing weight over the next few years. The estimated sales of wearable devices related to healthcare in 2019 will reach 245 million units, tripling 2015 figure. In the Smart Home field, the number of domestic smart devices will yearly grow +50% until 2019, by reaching between 500 and 700 million units in 2020. As far as mobility is concerned, the Italian market is one of the most mature on the front of cars connected. Nevertheless, in the period 2017-2022 a further annual growth in revenue of 24% is expected.</p>
<p>In partnership with <a href="http://www.insuranceup.it/">InsuranceUp.it</a>, <a href="https://openup.bnpparibas/">Openup</a>, and <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/">MEDICI</a>, FinTech’s Global Knowledge Network, Open-F@b Call4Ideas 2017 promoted by BNP Paribas Cardif is looking for the best technological and digital startups to build collaboration paths together, awarding the three best ideas that can be realized in solutions of prevention, security and wellness for the new customers, with a particular focus on health, family, home and mobility.</p>
