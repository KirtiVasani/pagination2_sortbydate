    <p>Believe it or not, tech-savvy <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/millennial-subscriptions-build-loyalty-predictability-subscription-for-new-millennials/">millennials</a> are <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/is-the-dusk-of-mobile-apps-inevitable/">ditching smartphone apps and mobile wallets</a> in favor of a longstanding payment method – <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/top-20-virtual-plastic-prepaid-debit-cards-for-travel-shopping-secure-international-use/">prepaid cards</a>. Once thought of as an option used only by the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/fintech-partnerships-path-to-reach-new-underbanked-customer/">underbanked</a>, prepaid cards are drawing serious interest from millennials. In fact,<a href="https://mediaroom.tdbank.com/2015-04-06-New-Survey-Signals-Rising-Popularity-of-Prepaid-Cards-Led-By-Millennials"> one in three Americans</a> ages 18 to 34 have used a prepaid debit card and 60% would consider using one.</p>
<p>Think income might be a factor? Think again.<a href="http://time.com/money/4182923/millennials-prepaid-cards/"> Three out of five millennials</a> who earn $100,000 or more report using prepaid cards. <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/mobile-wallets-when-too-many-pays-wont-let-anyone-win/">Lack of options doesn’t appear to be an issue</a>, either – 83% of millennial prepaid card users also have debit cards.</p>
<p>From avoiding debt to sidestepping traditional bank fees, here’s a look at what’s fueling prepaid cards’ rise among millennials and what it means for the businesses that employ them.</p>
<h4><strong>Why prepaid cards?</strong></h4>
<p>While relatively small, banking fees can quickly add up – and a growing number of millennials are starting to take notice of the various options now available to them. Banks charge an<a href="http://www.money-rates.com/research-center/bank-fees/"> average monthly fee of $13.22</a> on basic checking accounts. More importantly, even a small, accidental overdraft can incur significant punitive charges. To avoid such surprises, more millennials are opting for prepaid cards. Although these cards do come with fees, <b>many young users appreciate the ability to put a hard cap on their spending and avoid the costly overdraft fees</b> so typical of traditional bank accounts.</p>
<p>Which brings us to another key benefit: <b>prepaid cards can help users </b><a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/saving-vs-spending-opportunities-fintech-startups/"><b>stay debt-free</b></a>. The average US household owes approximately<a href="http://time.com/money/4607838/household-credit-card-debt/"> $16,000 in credit card debt</a>. By allowing cardholders to load the required funds prior to making a purchase, <b>prepaid cards help eliminate debt concerns</b> altogether. Having access only to the amount of funds available on a prepaid card can also benefit those who tend to overspend.</p>
<p>In addition to minimizing debt, <b>prepaid cards can even function as a learning tool for millennials</b> who are getting used to living – and spending – on their own. Unlike credit cards, which allow users to plunge deeper into debt, prepaid cards feature a set amount of money that can be tracked and spent – all without negatively impacting a credit score. </p>
<p>Finally, millennials are also opting for prepaid cards over credit and debit cards because of the <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/prepaid-cards-finally-get-fraud-protection/"><b>security benefits</b></a>. Whereas the latter can potentially give fraudsters sweeping access to an individual's financial assets, prepaid cards are not linked to any broader portfolio and typically have limited available funds.</p>
<h4><strong>Taking the pain out of payments</strong></h4>
<p>Considering their surge in popularity with millennials, it may be time for businesses to start looking at prepaid cards as a payment option for their workers. Doing so will not only boost engagement rates, but it may also demonstrate a company’s flexibility to potential prospects. Perhaps even more importantly, cardholders won’t have to deal with credit checks and overdraft fees commonly associated with credit cards.</p>
<p>As with any payment method, however, there are challenges both companies and workers should keep in mind. For example, if a prepaid card is lost or stolen, there may be fewer protections in place than there are with traditional debit or credit cards – although even this is being addressed through regulatory changes. And when it comes to bigger purchases, such as a house or car, credit cards help build the required credit history that prepaid cards often can’t – at least, not yet.</p>
<p>Still, the benefits of prepaid cards may outweigh the risks in the eyes of millennials. From fewer fees to a smaller chance of accruing debt, it’s easy to see why more millennials are opting for prepaid cards than ever before. By offering prepaid cards as a payout option, businesses can better cater to the needs and preferences of the largest working generation in the US.</p>
