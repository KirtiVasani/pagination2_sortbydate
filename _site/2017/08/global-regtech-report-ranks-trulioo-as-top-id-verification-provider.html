    <p><b>Vancouver, B.C. – (August 10, 2017) </b>Trulioo, the leading global identity verification company, is elated to announce that its flagship identity verification solution, GlobalGateway, was ranked first place for the second year running in the Verification/Identity Checks category of the <a href="http://www.bankingtech.com/941652/regtech-supplier-performance-report-ignorance-is-no-longer-bliss-its-now-criminal-offence/">2017 RegTech Performance Report</a>, published by Market Fintech Limited.</p>
<p>The report, which provides a clear view of the RegTech sector, also ranked Trulioo and its electronic identity verification platform, GlobalGateway, fourth in the Overall Supplier Rankings. The report focuses on what RegTech solutions are gaining market traction, what kind of institutions are deploying them as well as the scope of solutions and areas of compliances being addressed. </p>
<p><i>“For technology to enable companies to transform their business, it requires a vendor that truly understands the challenges faced every day by senior executives,”</i> said Tina Snelling, Editor of the RegTech Supplier Performance Report. <i>“The future leaders in RegTech will continue to be the ones that truly understand the business issues and see ‘tech’ as an enabler. Truiloo has once again demonstrated their leadership position through the significant uptake of their smart technology for instant verification of identities globally.”</i></p>
<p><i>“This report is a valuable tool, bringing insights to an emerging and highly complex area of financial technology,” </i>said Stephen Ufford, CEO of Trulioo.<i> “GlobalGateway was built from the ground up to address cross-border AML and KYC compliance in a transparent, fast and secure manner.”</i></p>
<p>Developed for an international market, GlobalGateway helps businesses to comply with a wide range of identity verification requirements, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML).</p>
<p><i>“RegTech is making a name for itself as it </i><i>allows FinTech to flourish and focus on innovation, while automating the more cumbersome processes of compliance, such as vetting clients and transactions to prevent money laundering and other financial crimes,” </i>Ufford continued.</p>
<p>RegTech providers have sprouted in recent years to accommodate the rapid growth of financial technology, offering innovative solutions to help meet various regulatory challenges while reducing the manual processes, and costs, associated with compliance.</p>
