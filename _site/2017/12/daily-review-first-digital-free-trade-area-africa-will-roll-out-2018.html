<h2 id="pick-1-africas-first-digital-free-trade-area-for-rollout-in-2018">Pick #1. Africa’s first digital free trade area for rollout in 2018</h2>

<p>Businesses within the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) could save up to $450 million in clearance documentation once the bloc adopts blockchain technology for clearing imports. Comesa is looking to roll out a digital free trade area – the first in Africa – modeled along the Malaysian Free Trade Zone, where parties to a transaction are connected in real time through a web of ledgers that are secure.</p>

<p>The application also supports the generation of an electronic certificate of origin whose authenticity can be verified using national information technology systems.</p>

<p>This will be a marked break from the current practice which involves manual applications and physical presentation of documents to tax bodies and other government agencies that cause businesses delays.</p>

<p>Trade financiers could be the biggest losers once the system is in place.</p>

<p>Amazon has already begun offering some types of insurance policies. This is through ‘Amazon Protect,’ a product that provides extensions to manufacturers’ warranties, insuring against accidental damage, breakdown, and theft. With this offering, when buying appliances like washing machines, mobile phones, tablets, televisions, kitchen appliances, and other electronic goods, shoppers are prompted if they want to add Amazon Protect coverage to their shopping basket at the time of checkout.</p>

<p>Amazon is expected to soon go beyond this product-related offering. The company has begun advertising in the European Union product for people with insurance and InsurTech experience. The online retailer states it is “launching a new business” and will be “creating a new palette of services.”</p>
