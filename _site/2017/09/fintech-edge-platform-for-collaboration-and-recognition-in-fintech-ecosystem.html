With the launch of FinTech EDGE in partnership with Rubique, CNBC-TV18 aims to set a new platform that recognizes the young icons, acts as a knowledge sharing platform that encourages entrepreneurship and innovation.”</i></p>

<p>Here are some of the important points that were highlighted by the panelists:</p>
<h6><b>Vivek Belgavi, Partner &amp; FinTech Leader at PwC:</b></h6>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">“Banks vs. FinTechs” is a debate that is long-forgotten. The world over, the move is toward a more collaborative approach.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The next level of differentiation for banks will come from partnerships with startups. In addition to having cutting-edge technologies, it will enable banks to increase reach in existing markets or penetrate new markets.</li>
</ul>
<h6><b>Chavi Jafa, Head of Business Solutions at Visa India &amp; South Asia:</b></h6>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">FinTechs have the advantage of agility which allows them to explore higher efficiencies and bridge gaps quicker than traditional players. However, collaboration across FinTechs and traditional players is key to scalability and success.</li>
</ul>
<h6><b>Suresh Sethi, Former CEO of M-Pesa, Vodafone:</b></h6>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Technology and digitization are the answer to drive frugal innovation in the financial services space.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">It is critical to leverage the same for driving last-mile financial inclusion at sustainable and affordable levels. This would, in turn, lead to the discovery of new revenue models built around data monetization in a data-rich ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h6><b>Harshil Mehta, CEO at DHFL:</b><b>
</b></h6>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">With digitally active millennials, consumer preferences, internet penetration, and technology upgrades coupled with the government’s efforts to digitize finance and boost digital platforms, India is growing to be a digitally democratic economy.</li>
</ul>
