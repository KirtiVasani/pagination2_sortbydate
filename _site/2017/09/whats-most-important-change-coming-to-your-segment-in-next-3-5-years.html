    <p>The year 2017 so far has been one of the most fascinating periods in the history of FinTech. Explosion of ICOs, revision of regulatory frameworks around the world, and a lot more. With such an unprecedented speed of changes in FinTech, it is a challenge to envision what <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/understand-future-of-financial-services-industry/">the future of the financial services</a> would look like.</p>

  <p>With the rapid advancement in payment technology, I see the need for collections diminishing. The days of traditional collections are ending. Agencies and the industry will need to either redefine themselves or become a casualty of innovation and disruption.

  <p>The biggest challenge facing retailers in the next 3-5 years will be mastering mobile. Mobile adoption has grown significantly in recent years, but we’re only now seeing a shift from people just browsing retailers’ websites or apps on their phones to actually converting and making purchases.</p>

  <p>In order to keep up with consumer demand, retailers will need to optimize their entire mobile experience, including the checkout process. Shoppers don’t want to waste time entering their 16-digit credit card number into a small screen. By giving shoppers more payment options that are faster and easier to use on mobile, retailers will be able to drive more sales with these mobile-centric shoppers. - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobbileach/">Bobbi Leach</a>, CEO, <a href="https://futurepay.com/">FuturePay</a></p>

<h2 id="lending">Lending</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important change is that more and more students and their families will use private student loans in place of income, retirement savings, credit cards and home equity lines to fund the education gap. Likewise, we see private student loans taking share from federal student loans, as the government looks to reset its balance sheet.</p>

  <p>We know the current White House administration is looking for ways to reduce some of the outstanding federal student loan debt, which now stands at $1.29 trillion. The Wall Street Journal reported that some 40% of federal student loan borrowers are not making repayments. That’s a problem that is unique to federal student loans; private student loan default rates are way below that in the single digits.</p>

  <p>One solution would be for the government to sell its loans to private lenders, who can then treat them like an investable asset. Or they might put limits on federal loans that aren’t need-based, like PLUS loans for graduate school or parents, which would position private student loans as an invaluable financing option.</p>

  <p>In terms of industry change, private student loans are really an untapped asset class. There’s an addressable market of $172 billion in annual higher education spending that’s not covered by federal aid. Currently, only $10 billion of higher education costs are funded with private student loans, and further opportunity exists in student loan consolidations and refinancing.</p>

  <p>As more financial institutions see how easy – low risk and profitable – it is to enter this asset class, we’ll see a stronger demand for origination, servicing, and insurance. More competition in the marketplace will lower the cost of borrowing capital and increase the terms and choices available to students. To put this another way, with more skin in the game, the incentives will grow for lenders, resulting in even better pricing for students. As it stands right now, we have more lending capacity than we have borrowers. We love being in this position and not being reliant on securitization markets. - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-vanerdewyk-695712b5/">Mike VanErdewyk</a>, Founder &amp; CEO, <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies/reliamax">ReliaMax Holding Company</a></p>

<h2 id="online-payments">Online Payments</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think there are two; I suspect there will be a wave of consolidation particularly for small country-specific operators. I think on the bigger industry landscape, compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) in some countries is patchy or poor at best. As online payments continue to grow in this region, so does the ever present risks of data breach to non-PCI DSS merchants exponentially grow. I feel there are interesting times ahead in this space. - <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/alan-pigott-bb99462">Alan Pigott</a>, Chief Executive, <a href="https://www.ipgpay.com/">IPGPAY Limited</a></p>

  <p>What we’re most excited to watch over the next five years is the evolution of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. We firmly believe that cryptocurrencies will be an integral part of the online payments landscape in one form or another, but it’s not clear altogether which technologies will survive and thrive. FinTech is in a period of massive transformation thanks to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.

  <p>If we are talking about the trends in the payment and banking industry, I personally think that we will see many changes in the way how people do their financial transactions that are technology-driven.</p>

  <p>I believe that especially blockchain technology will influence the process of redefining and redesigning financial services for many uses cases, but also other technologies like biometric identification and AI will help to simplify, for example, online and offline payments and shopping experience for average consumers. We already see the first steps in this direction with “Amazon Go.” - Natallia Martchouk, Co-Founder &amp; Managing Director, <a href="https://balancr.io/">balancr.io</a></p>

  <p>There will be more companies like Cashaa focused on including cash transfers – we frequently get approached by people asking us to launch our product in their country or build a similar version of Cashaa for them. So far, they are not our competition as there are so many opportunities worldwide that it leaves room for 20 copies of us.</p>

  <p>There have been predictions that cash use will decline to half in the next years in places like the UK, but it is not predicted that it is going to disappear, and there are countries still almost completely using cash. - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kgauravitc/?ppe=1">Kumar Gaurav</a>, Founder &amp; CEO, <a href="https://cashaa.com/">Cashaa</a></p>

  <p>There is a growing consensus that rental history reporting should be considered to reformulate credit scores. As you know, monthly rent payments are highly correlated with the ability to repay debt in a timely manner, yet they have not been one of the historically accepted data sources for calculating credit scores. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently put an inquiry out seeking feedback from the financial industry and the public about using alternative data such as rent payments to formulate credit scores. - <a href="https://twitter.com/johnsimpsonrr">John Simpson</a>, CEO, <a href="https://www.rentreporters.com/">RentReporters</a></p>

  <p>With an increasing demand for machine-learning technology, AI will continue to be a powerful force in regulatory compliance and risk assessment in the next five years. Manual tracking and operational administration will soon be replaced by automated tools that can adapt to the continuously changing regulatory rules. These technologies will eliminate tasks such as researching and tracking that can take days of work. We will also see an increase in financial institutions looking to imbue its processes and businesses with automated compliance offerings. - <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/briantclark1">Brian Clark</a>, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, <a href="https://medici.letstalkpayments.com/companies/ascent-technologies">Ascent Technologies</a></p>

  <p>The future of the market is that within the next 5–10 years, there will be no high street stores left. All financial services will be delivered via mobile. The FinTech industry will be a very different world in the future. Our world today is very much mobile-first and that could easily become mobile-only in the years to come. For financial services, that means that 2 billion more people will have smartphone-centric mobile wallets in places like Africa and Asia, putting them financially on grid – think about what that would mean for the families and the economies in those regions.</p>

  <p>As smartphone sales reach saturation point in developed markets, technology adoption growth is now solidly focused on emerging and developing nations. Following on from the success of domestic millennial-focused payment apps such as Venmo in the US, sending money mobile-to-mobile around the world, instantly and at low cost, will take off in 2017. - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssulistyo/">Stefan Sulistyo</a>, Co-Founder &amp; Chief Customer Officer, <a href="https://www.alyne.com/en/">Alyne GmbH</a></p>

  <p>The biggest challenge still facing the remittance industry is mobile. While other parts of the payments industry have been able to keep up with the rise of mobile payments, the remittance segment has traditionally lagged. In the next 3-5 years, the biggest change won’t just be the shift to a mobile-centric mentality but getting mobile right – seamlessly balancing user experience and security. Pangea is at the forefront of this push to serve the mobile-centric customer, as a vast majority of our existing customers access our platform through mobile devices. - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishuthukral/">Nishu Thukral</a>, CEO &amp; President, <a href="https://gopangea.com/send-money/">Pangea Money Transfer</a></p>

  <p>If you track the journey of the user, a lot of fulfillment of solutions still happens offline. Also, lack of interoperability between service providers creates barriers in consumer movement. Over the next few years, a majority of origination and fulfillment will happen online and there will be complete mobility of a user from one service provider to another. There will be a strong focus on advisory and convenience as value additive services which will be directly monetized from the user and not as commissions from product manufacturers. - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kushalkothari/">Kushal Kothari</a>, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, <a href="https://expowealth.in/">Expowealth Technologies Private Limited</a></p>
