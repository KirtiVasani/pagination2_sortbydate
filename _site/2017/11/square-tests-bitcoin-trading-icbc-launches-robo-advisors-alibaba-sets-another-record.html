    <p>As Bitcoin hits new highs, big FinTech firms flock to the cryptocurrency to meet consumer demand. Whether this is an attempt to ride the wave, or out of sincere belief in the future of cryptocurrency, Square's beta of cryptocurrency trading is certainly a positive sign for the affectionate community. </p>
<h2>Square Cash is letting some users buy and sell Bitcoin</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Square is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/11/14/square-cash-a-new-place-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoin/#70a568277194%C2%A0%E2%80%A6">testing</a> cryptocurrency support in their Cash app. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The trial, available right now to a small number of users, lets users buy and sell Bitcoin directly in the app. Users who have access to the beta can swipe right from the Cash Card page to access Bitcoin functionality.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Square is likely using pooled wallets to hold user funds and not storing private keys on a user’s device, similar to how Coinbase works.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the feature is centered around buying and selling Bitcoin and not sending and receiving. There’s a (potentially non-functioning) option to generate an address to receive Bitcoin, but no option to send it.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re always listening to our customers and we’ve found that they are interested in using the Cash app to buy Bitcoin. We’re exploring how Square can make this experience faster and easier, and have rolled out this feature to a small number of Cash app customers. We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system and we’re excited to learn more here.” – Square Spokesperson.</li>

<p>ICBC, the nation’s largest bank by assets becomes the first of China’s ‘big four’ lenders to offer automated advice and product service. </p>
<h2>ICBC launches robo-adviser service for wealth-management products</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC has applied the latest AI-led technology to its wealth-management operations. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Its newly launched robo-adviser service will see computer programs dish out investment advice to retail investors over its mobile banking platform, becoming the first among the nation’s “big four” state-owned lenders to unlock the potential of the hot new service being adopted rapidly by the industry, worldwide.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The value of China’s total robo-adviser services (banks + asset managers + FinTech) is expected to top US $783 billion by 2020. Globally, the segment is projected to reach US $6.5 trillion by 2025, up from US $100 billion in 2016. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">ICBC is the nation’s largest bank by assets, but small- and mid-sized mainland banks have already tested such services. </li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Total order numbers hit 812 million, up 23%.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba Cloud, which handled the infrastructure, managed 325,000 orders at peak.</li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">167 merchants generated over $15.1 million in sales each.</li>
