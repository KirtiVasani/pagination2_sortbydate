<td style="width: 676px;">I am deeply honored and humbled to receive this award. Especially in the face of the quality of the competition present here. The companies here are amongst the best in Asia and the world! It tempting to think it’s just because Spark is a good company but in reality, we are here thanks to the whole ecosystem in Singapore! The regulator MAS, the VCs, the willingness of investors to back projects and the many mentors who freely share their invaluable experience and insights. Our win here will importantly open doors and bring new and exciting opportunities to our doorstep.</td>
