    <p>Business lending has traditionally been dominated by institutional players. Over the past several years, however, a gap in SME financing has been taken close to the heart by technology giants and startups alike. "There are a number of tech companies that do small business lending in varying degrees," Rania Succar, Head of QuickBooks Capital at Intuit, told CNBC. "For example Square, PayPal and Amazon offer loans to merchants."</p>
<p>According to the Federal Reserve, only <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/intuit-unveils-business-lending-product-quickbooks-capital.html">23%</a> of businesses younger than five years get access to credit, which created a perfect environment for proliferation of alternative lenders. In fact, lending (along with payments) has long been <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/global-fintech-funding-36-bn-2016/">the most well-funded and represented segment in FinTech</a>.</p>
<p>Lending has become an extremely competitive space <i>– </i>companies for which it was never the primary focus are getting started with their own business financing arms (Intuit, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/31/marketinvoice-launches-business-loans-on-back-of-psd2-open-banking.html">MarketInvoice</a>). Meanwhile, positive momentum in Q3 earning results of more established players draws a promising future for the whole segment that has seen its share of hardships.</p>
<h2>Lending Club sees a healthy Q3 </h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Q3 loan originations hit a six-quarter high of $2.4 billion, up 14% from $2.1 billion in Q2, and 20% from $2 billion in Q3 2016.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Q3 revenue hit a record high of $154 million, up 10% from $140 million in Q2, and 34% from $115 million in last year's quarter. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The revenue boost helped consolidated net losses narrow to $6.7 million from $25.4 million in Q2, and $36.5 million in Q3 2016.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Lending Club continued to expand its securitization program to build out an additional revenue stream. It has also begun implementing an updated credit model that better reflects current economy and protects investor yields. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Although Lending Club's latest results fell below analysts' expectations, they nevertheless demonstrated a continued upward trajectory. </li>
