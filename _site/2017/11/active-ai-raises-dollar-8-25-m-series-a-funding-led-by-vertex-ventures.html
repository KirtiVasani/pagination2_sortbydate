    <p><b>Singapore &amp; Bangalore, India </b><b>–</b><b> Nov 13, 2017</b><b> –</b> Active.Ai, a Singapore-headquartered FinTech platform with an innovation lab in Bengaluru that delivers conversational banking through artificial intelligence (AI), announced a US $8.25 million Series A financing led by Vertex Ventures, Creditease Holdings, and Dream Incubator. Existing investors Kalaari and IDG Ventures India will also participate in the round. Ben Mathias, Managing Partner at Vertex Ventures, and Vani Kola, Managing Director at Kalaari Capital, will join Sanat Rao from IDG Ventures India on the company’s board of directors. Anju Patwardhan from Creditease will join as a board observer.</p>
<p>Active-Ai’s proprietary AI engine, Triniti, enables financial institutions to have a meaningful engagement with their customers in an intuitive natural format over multiple apertures covering messaging, voice, and IOT devices.

Keeping in mind the requirements of financial institutions, the company offers the flexibility of deployment: on-premise or in the cloud.</p>
<p>Founded in early 2016, the company is working with some of the top-tier banks and insurance companies in India, Malaysia, Singapore, and North America. It is planning to expand into other verticals like wealth management and securities trading. The company’s vision is to become the AI platform of choice for leading financial services companies across the world.</p>
<p>Ravi Shankar, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Active Intelligence, said, “I am excited by the future possibilities of AI and how this technology will shape the banking and financial world.

With the fresh injection of funds, Active.ai will scale up and continue to hire talented people for the AI team and focus on building the best enterprise product in the market.”</p>
<p>Ben Mathias from Vertex Ventures said, “I am very excited to partner with the Active.ai team to redefine the paradigm of customer experience in financial services.
