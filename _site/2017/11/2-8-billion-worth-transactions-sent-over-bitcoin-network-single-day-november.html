    <p>Bitcoin crosses new highs every other week despite sometimes unfavoring regulations coming into action. Last week was no exception – the value of daily transactions sent through Bitcoin network went from $200 million for the most part if January to $2.8 billion in a single day of November 16. Predictions suggest that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-could-reach-10000-in-few-months-with-fund-managers-bullish-sentiment">Bitcoin will cross $10,000 in a few months</a> – a new record for daily transactions is not far. </p>
<h3>Bitcoin Now Processes $2 Billion Worth Of Transactions Per Day, A 10x Increase In 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">For most of January, roughly $200 million worth of Bitcoin was being sent around the Bitcoin network per day. Near the end of May, days where more than $700 million was transacted on the network were common.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly a billion dollars of value was sent around the Bitcoin network per day in early August. This number declined down to $600 million by late September before exploding to $1.5 billion by late October.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">November 16 set a new all-time high for value transacted over the Bitcoin network in a single day at $2,803,405,660.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Public transportation is the new battleground for Chinese dragons: WeChat Hitches Ride on Guangzhou Metro</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Guangzhou Metro passengers can now pay for their rides with the WeChat messaging app, as <a href="https://u.caixinglobal.com/search/%22Tencent%22.html">Tencent</a> competes with its rival Alibaba to get on track in the public transportation sector.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Commuters in the southern metropolis have been able to take the subway after allowing the turnstile to scan a QR code generated by a WeChat in-app mini program. The turnstiles can scan the codes within 0.3 seconds. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The system also supports offline payments. Passengers without an internet connection can travel first and pay later when they are next online.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As on the Guangzhou Metro, travelers on the Shanghai maglev line can use Alipay to pay for their tickets by scanning a QR code.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The public transportation sector has recently become the latest battleground for major mobile payment players like Tencent and Alibaba, who both hope to make an early entrance and secure a better position.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">WeChat faces competition from payment service provider UnionPay, which has also joined with Guangzhou Metro to provide mobile payment services for passengers.</li>
